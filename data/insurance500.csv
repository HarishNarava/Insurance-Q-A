However, there are several advantages of buying a term insurance policy. These include:

Term Insurance
Security in terms of finances: Term insurance plans are one of the most effective ways to create financial security. This is especially relevant in the modern era, as a term insurance plan safeguards the financial stability of the policyholder’s dependents should the policyholder die.
Basic insurance product: Instead of choosing a plan with dozens of additional benefits and paying an exorbitant premium, choose term insurance with a stable, low-cost premium for nearly the same benefits.
Greater returns: Term plans also cater to the needs of all types of investors. Term insurance provides better returns without the hassle of managing investment funds, as the return on investment is usually much higher than the money put in. Both the Regular plan and the TROP plan offer up to 105% returns on premiums paid at maturity.
Coverage in times of needs: Under term insurance policies, you can choose the sum assured so that it provides you with sufficient coverage. Financial experts say that sufficient coverage is equal to 10 times your yearly income. It is important to note that inadequate coverage defeats the purpose of insurance. Similarly, it is important for you to evaluate your insurance coverage and identify areas where you can reduce costs to avoid over-insurance.
Survival benefits: While a regular term insurance plan does not have any survival benefits, a number of insurers have designed plans, i.e., Term Return of Premium Plans (TROPs), that offer survival benefits in the form of premium refunds at maturity.
Policy term: Term insurance plans offers the policyholder with a fixed term coverage. This indicates that they can take term insurance for a fixed duration wherein their family is financially protected. Following this, they can retire comfortably.
Low claim rejection: Claim rejections are observed to be lower if a life insurance policy has been active for more than 10 years.
Flexibility -:Most term plans provide you the choice of purchasing the coverage in person or online. Additionally, if the amount assured under the plan is Rs. 50 lakh or less, many insurers do not require health examinations.
Riders: Term plans can be enhanced through the use of riders that offer extra protection. These riders can be bought from the insurance company at nominal costs. Some of the riders available under term plans are accidental death benefit, critical illness, partial or permanent disability, waiver of premium, etc.
Low brokerage: In case policyholder opt opt for an offline term insurance policy, they will be paying the lowest amount as broker commission. Brokerage is usually calculated as a percentage of the premium paid. Since the premium for term insurance policies are usually low, the overhead of broker charges is also reduced. If they choose an online plan, there will be no broker fees as well.
Flexible payment options: Term insurance policies offer flexible premium payment options, allowing policyholders to choose a payment plan based on their convenience. Premiums can be either limited pay, single pay or regular pay. Policyholders who choose limited or regular pay plans can pay their premiums either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually.
Choice of plan: A number of insurers offer policyholders a choice when it comes to the type of plan they wish to opt for. Policyholders can choose between single or joint life plans, depending on their need. They can thus choose to extend coverage for dependent spouses or choose a plan exclusively for the breadwinner of the family.
Tax benefits: Last, but not least, premiums paid towards a term plan is eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The death benefit received by the nominee under the plan is eligible for tax deductions under Section 10(10D) as well.

Insurance,How does Term Insurance Work?,"A term insurance policy can be considered one of the most traditional forms of insurance. Most of the term insurance plans have a premium that increases in small amounts over a period of time. This is to account for a reduction in the value for money as years pass by. It also covers the increase in mortality risk and the extra levies imposed for a longer coverage term.

To understand how it works, have a look at it in these three situations:

Buying the policy: To be able to buy a term insurance policy you don't need to put aside tens of thousands of rupees every year. Many of the insurance policies can offer you a sum assured of up to Rs. 1 crore for a premium that could be as little as about Rs. 10,000 per annum (These are indicative figures. The actual premiums may differ depending on the sum assured and the insurance providers).
Keeping the policy: Just like any other insurance policy, you pay the premium towards these policies at a frequency chosen by you. These premiums can be paid every month, every quarter, every 6 months or once a year. They can also be paid as a lump sum instead of being paid at regular intervals.
Redeeming the benefits: Term insurance plans don't usually come with any maturity benefits. Term insurance plans don't typically come with any maturity benefits, except for term insurance with. Their main objective is to provide life insurance cover and that is exactly what they do. In case the policy holder passes away, the person who is named as the beneficiary of the policy will receive the sum assured.
The way it works is also one reason why you will notice that a lot of the time insurers refer to these plans as pure protection plans. There are no frills attached to the plan. You pay the premium and you get a fixed sum if case something happens to you."
Insurance,Points to note while buying term insurance policy?,"Some important points to keep in mind while buying online term insurance are as follows:

Premium may vary in the future: The online price quote you receive is provided on the basis of an assumption that you carry normal risk in terms of health, occupation, and your family's medical history. After you submit all relevant documentation, the insurer may request you to undergo medical tests to arrive at the actual policy cost. In case the medical reports indicate that you are exposed to certain risks, the premium for your insurance may rise.
Do not let the policy move into lapsed status: The act of buying an online insurance plan is certainly a smart move. However, you should not let the policy lapse by missing premium payments. Since there would be no insurance agent reminding you of the premium payment due date, it is easy to miss renewing the insurance. It is advisable to send an ECS mandate to your bank so that the premium amount is automatically deducted on the due date. Setting up an alert on your mobile phone or computer is also a great way to remind yourself of the payment date.
Do not hide relevant facts while applying: If you are a smoker or use tobacco in any other form, your insurance premium will be 25%-30% higher than that of an individual who does not use tobacco. However, you should never hide this information in your application for insurance. At the time of a claim, if the insurer finds that the customer had concealed information, the claim will be rejected. The insurer may also cancel the policy, as applicable.
Your insurance policy is the backbone of your family's financial security. So, you should not get into a situation where the insurer annuls the plan.

The claims settlement ratio for each insurance company for a given year is made public by the IRDA.
Riders / Add-on covers: It is also important to take into account the riders that the insurance provider offers in addition to the standard policy. A secure insurance is one that includes both additional benefits and riders in addition to the standard coverage, and insurers that offer a large selection of riders are regarded as solid choices.
Cost: The amount you would be paying in terms of premium for the protection offered is a key factor in selecting a term insurance policy. Given that these policies can have a tenure of up to 20 years, the amount being paid annually as premium is a significant amount. Thus companies that offer reasonable protection for low premiums are preferred by policyholders.
Inflation: When selecting a term insurance policy, take into account factors like inflation. Term insurance policies are usually taken for 10-20 years, during which time inflation will erode the value of the rupee, resulting in lower returns at the time of maturity. To offset this, consider companies that offer plans where the cover increases by 5% - 10% annually to keep in line with inflation.
Policy comparison: It is advisable to compare insurance plans online so that you have a clear idea of the options available to you. The facility of policy comparison is offered by neutral third-party financial websites, free of cost. So, it is wise to make use of this facility as much as possible.
Engage an insurance advisor: In case you feel that you are unable to decide on a plan by yourself you can always seek the assistance of an insurance advisor for the same. This way you can be assured of expert insurance advice/suggestions that would enable you to pick the right policy.
Policy terms and conditions: It is vital that you read the terms and conditions within the policy document thoroughly before signing the dotted line. This enables you to understand the minute details pertaining to the inclusions and exclusions under the plan, so that there is no confusions in the future.

Anyone who wants to estimate the premium that will need to be paid can use the premium calculator facility.

You must enter information into the premium calculator for the majority of insurance providers, including your gender, date of birth, and whether you smoke or not. You must also enter the needed coverage quantity (based on your needs).

After doing so, a screen will show the premium amount that must be paid. The maximum policy term made available by the insurer would be used to determine the premium amount.

Under the amount due for the premium, there would be a display of any supplementary benefits that were part of the policy. A premium cost will be given based on the type of plan and the coverage it gives, and some insurers will provide an estimate based on the insurance plan chosen. If someone wants to choose a certain term insurance policy, the premium calculator is a great tool to use to verify their premium contribution."

Insurance,What Factors affect term insurance Premium,"When it comes to term insurance, there are several factors which affect the premiums which the insurer quotes on your policy. These factors are:

Age:Your age plays a major role in the premium you pay on your policy. The younger you are, the lower your premiums are likely to be and the older you are, the higher your premiums will be. It is always advised to purchase a life insurance policy when you are young.
Your family's medical history:If your family has a medical history of any critical or life-threatening illness/condition like cancer, diabetes, etc., then you will be considered a higher risk as compared to someone who does not have a family history of any major life-threatening disease/condition. A high-risk applicant will be charged higher premiums automatically.
Your health:Insurers will also look at the state of your health at the time you apply for the policy and also in the past. If you have been suffering from any chronic illness in the past or your current medical condition indicates any future health issues like high blood pressure, your policy premium rates might be affected. Applicants who are generally healthy often have to pay lower premiums in comparison.
Weight:People who are obese or overweight on the weight to height ratio scale may be asked to shell out more in terms of policy premiums as they carry greater chances of medical issues in the future.
Smokers:It is commonly advertised by insurance providers that non-smokers are eligible for special discounted premium rates on policies as compared to smokers. This is because smokers may be at a higher risk of cancer or other smoking related health hazards as compared to a non-smoker.
Alcohol consumption:Like smoking, alcohol consumption can also lead to health problems. Which is why insurers will enquire about your lifestyle habits during application as heavy alcohol consumption is linked to several health complications, increasing the applicant's risk.
Lifestyle habits:Those who often indulge in high-risk activities for leisure such as skydiving, bungee jumping, paragliding, hang-gliding or any other form of adventure sporting activity are seen as high-risk applicants and may be required to pay higher premiums. However, there are several insurers who have designed policies specially covering these high-adrenaline activities.
Applicant's gender:Insurance providers often advertise lower premium rates for women applicants as compared to men. This may be due to the fact that women usually have longer lifespans as compared to men."
Insurance,How To Choose The Right tenure for Your Term Plan,"One of the main reason why term plans are preferred over other types of insurance plans is because it provides cover at affordable prices for a duration that the customer needs. However, when it comes to term insurance, how does one decide the term for which the plan should be taken? The right duration for a term plan will differ from individual to individual, depending on their unique financial situation. When deciding the term of a term insurance plan, you must consider the financial liabilities which your family may have to face if you pass away and how long it would take for those liabilities to be paid off. Some of the factors you must consider when choosing the term of your term plan are:

LiabilitiesLiabilities can come in many forms, such as loans or mortgages and must be paid in or before time to avoid penalty. When you choose the term for your term insurance, it is advisable to consider the time it would be required to pay off such liabilities. For instance, if you have a home loan which will be fully repaid in a period of 20 years, then your policy term must be a minimum of 20 years.
Commitments or Dependents If you have dependents like young children who are financially dependent on you, the term of your plan must ideally be the duration (no. of years) till your can children support themselves. You must also take into account milestone life events like weddings, or starting a career when deciding the term of your policy. Ideally these events must fall within the term of the policy so that in case you may not be around to financially provide for your family, their needs are still taken care of.
AffordabilityLong term plans are significantly more expensive than short term insurance plans. When choosing the term for your plan, you must first consider whether you are financially comfortable paying the premiums over a longer period of time or not. Long term plans provide cover for a longer duration but are more expensive. Short term plans are relatively more affordable and also provide cover for a sizeable number of years."
Insurance,What is a Term Insurance rider ?,"Term Insurance rider is the extra cover a policyholder can opt for with their base term insurance policy to extend their coverage benefits. A policyholder can buy a term insurance rider by paying an additional premium amount.

Types of Term Insurance Riders
Most term insurance plans come with riders, which differ in terms of cost as well as terms and conditions. To understand types of term insurance riders in detail, read below:

1. Accidental Death Benefit Rider: With an accidental death benefit rider, one can avail an additional sum assured in case the insured dies in the misfortunate event of an accident. The additional sum assured is calculated on the basis of the original sum assured and may differ from one company to another. The premium remains fixed for this rider, for the entire policy term. However, some plans may put a cap on the maximum sum assured that can be availed.

2. Accelerated Death Benefit Rider: The family of a person suffering from a terminal illness like cancer, asthma, kidney failure, lung damage, etc. ends up paying a huge amount for medical expenses incurred due to the treatment. But with accelerated death benefit riders, the family receives a part of the sum assured in advance, which can be of great help in difficult times.

3. Accidental Disability Benefit Rider: In the unfortunate event of an accident, if the insured suffers from partial or permanent disability, then they can be benefited from this rider. Most of the time, term insurance plans pay you for 5-10 years after the accident causing disability, if you are covered under accidental disability benefit rider. Often coupled with accidental death riders, this rider can be treated as a source of income.

4. Critical Illness Benefit Rider: With a critical illness benefit rider, the insured can receive a lump sum amount on diagnosis of listed critical illnesses as specified in the policy document. Generally, term insurance plans cover you for cancer, stroke, paralysis, kidney failure, heart attack, major organ transplant, amongst others. The policy can either be continued or terminated after diagnosis of a critical illness, as per the terms and conditions stated in the policy.

5. Waiver of Premium Rider: As the name suggests, it waves off the future premiums in case the policyholder is not able to pay future premiums due to disability or loss of income. It can be said that this way you can ensure your premium payments until the policy gets expired. In case the insured does not have a waiver of premium rider, and suffers from a disability or is unable to pay the required premium due to some other reason, then the policy will expire and no death benefit will be paid as the premiums were not paid.

6. Income Benefit Rider: This is another useful rider that can be purchased by paying an extra premium at the time of policy purchase. Income benefit rider can be treated as a source of income in the misfortunate event of the death of the policyholder. With this rider, the family of the policyholder can avail additional income every year along with the regular sum assured, for up to 5-10 years.

Insurance,How to Save Tax with a Life Insurance Policy?,"Being insured in today’s date is of utmost importance. Even if your partner has a life insurance policy and a group policy from his/her company, it is important that you purchase a comprehensive life cover for yourself. Covering your life will not reduce the emotional distress that you may be going through, but a life insurance policy will ensure that you have adequate financial backup during times of your need. The insurance market is currently flooded with insurers selling a horde of insurance products and services. While selecting a particular life insurance policy, it is imperative to understand the tax implications of the same.

Section 80C of the Income Tax Act Deduction: If you are currently paying a premium towards your life insurance policy or for the life of your parents, children, or spouse, you will be eligible for a deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Irrespective of whether your child is a minor or not, the deduction shall be applicable. However, in order to be able to claim the said deduction, the premium amount (being paid by the policyholder) must not be more than 10% of the sum assured amount, in case the policy was issued after 1 April 2012.
Section 10(10D) Maturity Deduction: If the premium amount (being paid by the policyholder) does not surpass 10% of the sum assured for plans that have been issued post 1 April 2012 and 20% of the sum assured for plans that have been issued before 1 April 2012, then the maturity amount that the policyholder receives at the end of the policy term will be completely exempt from tax as per Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
GST on Life Insurance Premium

When life insurance companies calculate the premium for each individual, there are certain factors that are taken into consideration. Since life insurance is a form of investment, even low premiums have the potential to yield relatively high returns over a period of time. However, availing a life insurance policy with a low premium may not always be possible as you will have to meet some requirements as laid down by the insurer.

The following are some of the details of cash value of life insurance plans:

Share of your plan that earns interest and makes the fund available for borrowing or withdrawal
This cash value can be used for various purposes, such as a loan source or for planning premium payment
Cash value helps in wealth building and adds savings to your life cover
 Cash value divides your premium into two parts:
o   One portion helps in wealth creation and earns interest

o   While the other portion helps in covering the cost of financial security

Once enough cash value has been accumulated it can be received at the time of maturity or apply for loan in case of emergency

Insurance,What are the Late Charges on Life Insurance Premiums?,"Here are some details regarding late charges on life insurance premiums:

Policyholders will need to pay penalties on late charges on life insurance premiums
The penalty amount varies depending on policy and the insurer
To revive the policy through ‘reinstatement’, policyholders need to pay all the outstanding premiums with applicable interest rates will be applicable
Late payment charges also depend on the duration for which premium payment is due
 Life insurance plan can be revived within five years of last premium paying date"

Select auto-debit option so that you do not miss out on premium payments
Select reminder option before premium payment date to avoid delayed payment
Keep track of the premium payment reminders
Opt for yearly premium payment instead of monthly payments to avoid missing out on regular payments
Life Insurance Exclusion

Death caused while performing criminal or unlawful activities
Death caused by man-made disasters like war, riot, etc.
Suicide or any self-inflicted injury
Death caused while participating in adventure sports or any dangerous activities like bungee jumping, rock climbing, etc.
Death from HIV or any other sexually transmitted diseases
Death or harm caused by indulging in illegal intoxicants
Death caused during the waiting period is not covered by life insurance policies"
Insurance,Is  Disability  Insurance  Required  By  Law?,"Not generally. There are five states that require most all employers carry short term disability insurance on their employees. These states are: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Besides this mandatory short term disability law, there is no other legislative imperative for someone to purchase or be covered by disability insurance."
Insurance,Can  Creditors  Take  Life  Insurance  After  Death?,"If the person who passed away was the one with the debt, creditors generally cannot take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was a person. The money then belongs to that beneficiary, and as long as creditors do not have a claim against the beneficiary, they cannot take life insurance proceeds from them."
Insurance,Does  Travelers  Insurance  Have  Renters  Insurance?,"One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes, you can purchase Renters insurance through Travelers. I would look for a local agent who can assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested. I am sure the local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other carries as well."
Insurance,Can  I  Drive  A  New  Car  Home  Without  Insurance?,"Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car. It is never a good idea to drive a car without insurance. If you traded a car in, then the coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily, but you need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed. Most dealerships have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well."
Insurance,Is  The  Cash  Surrender  Value  Of  Life  Insurance  Taxable?,"Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance, never with Term. It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive. That amount includes both what you put in and what profit you made. The profit is taxable, just as most profit would be taxable. A far better idea would be NOT to surrender your Whole Life Policy, but instead to keep it and borrow against it and either then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish. You continue to grow in value, even when the loan is out, and your policy stays in force, although the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back. There are numerous option you should discuss with a qualified agent. Gary Lane, Registered Representative, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Call anytime. Thank you."
Insurance,How  Is  Annuity  Income  Reported?,"The good news is that annuity income is usually reported by the insurance company issuing the annuity. When they make a disbursement they also issue appropriate documentation to assist in filing your taxes. They send identical information to the Internal Revenue Service. Generally speaking when money is withdrawn from an annuity it is treated as interest and then taxed as ordinary income until the interest is exhausted and only the basis (the sum of premiums paid) remains. That money can be recovered free of income tax. If the annuity is annuitized, that is paid out in monthly installments either over an extended period of time or the lifetime of the annuitant, then an exclusion factor is determined and applied to each payment. A part of each payment will be taxed as ordinary income. The bad news is that these principles apply to non-qualified annuities held by individuals and these barely touch all the situations that can arise and the taxation of those unique situations. While this response is not meant to take the place of legal and accounting professional advice it should alert you to some of the complexities of taxing annuities. The most obvious situation is when an annuity is held as an asset of qualified pension plan. This includes defined benefit plans; defined contribution plans (401(k), IRAs and many others. The income taken by these plans is taxed as ordinary income unless it is taken prior to age fifty-nine and a half. If taken earlier it could be subject to a penalty tax of an additional ten per cent. Where annuities taxation becomes complex is when deferred annuities are transferred. That is when a person gives another person an annuity on their life, or the life of a third party. The basic rule is that the transfer is treated as surrender and taxed accordingly. The annuity that is transferred is treated as having been fully paid. It then has a basis of the value that was taxed. For estate planning reasons the ownership of an annuity is sometimes held by a trust and this leads to another set of taxation considerations involving the non-natural person rule. Who is going to be taxed is the basic issue and this can be quite tangled. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules. Taxation is fairly straightforward if the annuity is annuitized. State laws concerning probate can create some unexpected outcomes and taxation. When an individual owns an annuity and the annuitant is another person, perhaps a spouse, the death of the owner triggers the beneficiary provision and another third person could suddenly own the contract upsetting the intentions of the couple, even if it is a child. Many of the taxation rules are specific to individual insurance companies and it is wise to carefully make sure that the company you select from whom to purchase the annuity follows the procedures that will maintain your plan and keep taxation as uncomplicated as possible. Absent all other plans, the IRS frequently calls for a liquidation of a transferred annuity within five years. The key is the desire to get the tax question settled."
Insurance,What  Does  AAA  Home  Insurance  Cover?,"AAA Home insurance, like all other major carriers, covers a wide variety of claims, including fire, theft, vandalism, and many other items. However, there are numerous types of policies offered, so it is best to determine the type of policy you have to accurately understand all of the benefits. An experienced broker can help."
Insurance,What  Is  A  Simple  Retirement  Plan?,"what is a SIMPLE retirement plan? A Simple is an inexpensive opportunity for a small business to have a retirement plan that doesn't break the bank in advisor fees. A Simple plan is an IRS approved plan with only a few steps to follow so expensive testing and record keeping aren't necessary. For any small business who are considering a retirement plan to offer, this should be right on top as it does provide a great platform for a business who would rather use it's money to put towards employees retirements rather than third party administers plans."
Insurance,What  Does  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  Cover?,Social Security Disability Insurance pays a monthly benefit to people who cannot work due to a disability. The benefit is paid in cash to the recipient to use as they wish; it is not paid to an institution or entity. An injury or illness that causes the person to be unable to work is covered.
Insurance,Is  Car  Insurance  Prepaid?,"Yes, automobile insurance is typically paid in advance. Normally no less than thirty days at a time. Each carrier sets their own requirements as to the initial payment amount for new coverage. Most carriers allow clients to pay monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If you pay your premium in full for semi-annual or annual you may also receive a discount on your rate ( this is solely at the discretion of the carrier )."
Insurance,What  Does  Medicare  Part  B  Cover?,"Medicare Part B covers the doctor services, outpatient hospital services, medical services and supplies. There is a monthly cost charged to the Social Security check received. There is a deductible and 20% copayments if incurred. In addition you pay all costs for services and supplies not covered by Medicare."
Insurance,Can  Veterans  Get  Life  Insurance?,"Unless a service person gets Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI) within a year from separating from the service, their Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) will end and they will need to get a private policy. Contact an agency or website that carries several products to choose from to find the best rate for Veteran's life insurance."
Insurance,Does  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Lost  Wedding  Ring?,"Great question. Generally no, your Homeowners' policy will not cover for anything that is lost. This is referred to as ""Mysterious Disappearance"" in your policy documents and is usually listed as a specific exclusion. That having been said, you can certainly obtain coverage for such a loss by working with your insurance professional and asking that the item be insured specifically either as a rider which is attached to your Homeowners' policy or as a stand alone separate policy. You will need to provide a current appraisal and the item would be insured to the stated amount on the appraisal. Such riders or separate policies (commonly referred to as ""Personal Inland Marine"") include much broader coverage than does a standard Homeowners policy and will cover for such a loss."
Insurance,How  Does  Assigned  Risk  Auto  Insurance  Work?,Assigned risk in California which is what I amfamiliarwith is a processing center by which people having trouble buying auto insurance are connected with an insurance company that will insure them. Assigned Risk is not an insurance company but are companies that are required by law to participate. The amount of autos an insurance company has on the road would constitute the percentage of their obligation to the plan. There is financial hardship criteria to qualify for Assigned Risk. Also agents who offer Assigned Risk must becertifiedto offer this coverage. You can go online and then beconnectedto an agent to see if you qualify for assigned risk.
Insurance,Can  My  Boyfriend  Add  Me  To  His  Car  Insurance?,If you are living in the same household then he should put you on the list of drivers. The insurance follows the car and that is linked to a household. The person buying the insurance is in the household and can loan the car to whoever he wishes. The insurance covers the automobile. If you are not living together there wouldnt be anything gained by putting you on the policy.
Insurance,Do  I  Need  A  Police  Report  To  Submit  A  Claim  For  A  Car  Accident  On  Private  Property?,"Actually, though the local police might prepare an accident report for you, in many cases, because the incident occured on private property, it is more likely that they would take no action at all. Therefore, if it is possible, it becomes more important to exchange information with the other party involved. I would also recommend that neither car be moved and that you take photos for your records and that of your Insurance Company to help in the processing of the claim."
Insurance,Does  Full  Coverage  Auto  Insurance  Cover  Repairs?,"By ""Full Coverage"" I am assuming you mean, does carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage cover repairs? If you have a covered claim i.e. -an accident, hit a deer, backed into your wife's car like I did the other week - then yes, carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage would pay to fix those covered damages subject to your poilcy deductible. If you are experiencing general vehicle issues, i.e. - motor running roof, transmission mission or other general wear and tear - no, your insurance coverage would not come into play in these cases. Insurance only comes into play to repair a vehilce when there is a covered claim."
Insurance,Is  Life  Insurance  Acceptable  In  Islam?,"Do to its use of interest and chance there are those who believe that insurance is not permitted in Islam (i.e. that it is haram or sinful). Due to the spiritual nature of this question, you should seek the advice of an Imam for further guidance on Islam's position on insurance."
Insurance,Will  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tubal  Reversal?,"Most insurance plans will not cover the reversal of a voluntary sterilization or any treatments designed to overcome infertility. There are fifteen states with insurance mandates requiring some form of coverage for infertility, but every one of these mandates specifically excludes covering reversal surgeries. The best alternative is to take advantage of the tax deductible expenses, and to buy extra coverage for any resulting pregnancy: lower deductible health insurance, short term disability, hospital indemnity."
Insurance,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Can  You  Get  If  You  Have  Been  Diagnosed  With  Breast  Cancer?,"Traditionally, you can get up to 20-30x your income level of life insurance. The medical history does not necessarily limit how much you can get. The medical history determines the risk classification which controls the premiums for the coverage you want to put in place. When it comes to breast cancer, the details of the medical condition will determine which carriers will offer coverage and what the risk classification would be (each carrier has different underwriting, you may not get the same risk class offer from each of them), The best thing to do is to shop the case via an independent insurance agent/broker who can shop it to multiple companies. You do NOT want to apply to multiple companies as this can work against you due to the MIB (Medical Information Bureau) - from a company's point of view, it's sort of like a red flag if you will if they saw you applied to multiple companies which they can check the MIB for. In order to secure the most accurate quotes for the coverage, a number of factors would need to be known such as when the cancer was diagnosed, what stage is it in/was it in, how was it treated, has treatment been completed, are there anymore tests scheduled or that need to be completed, are you being treated for any other conditions, what prescriptions do you take, family medical history, and other factors. If you have a copy of the pathology report, that will help with a lot of the input. If cancer is current, guaranteed-issue whole life (GIWL) will be the only type of coverage available as it doesn't have any medical questions or exam requirements. However, the amount of coverage available under a single policy is $20,000-$25,000, depending on the carrier. To get more than that, you would need to stack multiple policies. Under GIWL policies, they traditionally feature a 2 or 3 year graded period - meaning you only have accidental death coverage during those periods, otherwise the carrier just returns the premiums paid into the policy if death occurs during the graded period. After the graded period expires, the full benefit is payable. Carriers typically only issue fully-underwritten coverage if the cancer has been in remission/treatment completed for at least 2 years. Many carriers prefer 5+ years from the date treatment was completed for a more favorable risk class. Send me a message via the ""contact me"" button by my profile picture if you would like me to assist with your coverage. My group is licensed with about 50 different carriers in numerous states. I hope the information is helpful - please let me know how I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
Insurance,What  Do  I  Need  To  Register  For  Medicare?,If you have paid taxes into the system then enrollment is automatic. You should receive your Medicare card and a packet of information from Medicare shortly before you turn 65 or qualify for Medicare if you are on disability. If you do not receive your card by the time you turn 65 then you need to call your Social Security office or 1-800-MEDICARE.
Insurance,Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Work?,"Short-term Disability does work if you have a qualifying disability. When you are applying for short or long-term disability, you need to look at the definition of disability and occupation. Not all companies have the same definition. If the definition is vague, you may find yourself being denied on your claim or receiving a ""lesser"" amount then what you have applied for."
Insurance,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Pool?,"In short, the answer is yes. But it needs to be clarified whether you are asking for property damage to the pool itself or liability coverage. Both would be covered barring any specific pool exclusions, which I am not aware of any in the standard market. If someone were to get injured while swimming in the pool, yes, your homeowners policy should cover you for liability. Likewise, if you pool is damaged due to the standard homeowners causes of loss less any standard exclusions then the pool would be covered for property damage to the pool itself. Keep in mind that wear and tear would not be covered under your policy. So if your pool liner rips ""just because"" or the concrete foundation cracks, those would be considered wear and tear. Please note that many insurance carriers are very cautious when writing homeowners insurance on homes that have pools. Some do not like to write them with a pool exposure, some do not mind, so be sure to ask your agent how it might affect your current coverage and future coverage and what the premium impact might be. You also want to strongly consider higher liability limits in purchasing an umbrella or if you already have an umbrella policy then higher umbrella limits. It might cost you $150 for each additional $1 mil limit. Lastly, if you have a pool and want to make sure you are covered for the proper limits, make sure your coverage B (other structures) limit is sufficient to cover any losses to your pool and any other structures i.e. detached garages, sheds as well."
Insurance,When  Do  I  Have  To  Sign  Up  For  Medicare?,"You should sign up for Medicare in the three months before the month of your 65th birthday, the month of your 65th birthday, or in the three months following the month of your 65th birthday. If you miss that enrollment period you can sign up between Jan 1 and March 31 each year."
Insurance,Will  An  MIP  Affect  My  Car  Insurance?,"That is a great question! If you are the minor in question with the possession charge, you better bet it will. If the minor was someone in your car with you, and not you, you might get lucky and the insurance company won't find out. Now the fact that you were allowing the breaking of the law, suggests that your decision making skills need some work, and that as a result, at some point yes, that will affect your policy, as you will most likely be filing some claims. Please consider this a serious wake up call. Too many teenagers die as a result of drunk driving, and you don't ( and neither does anyone else on the road with you) need to be another sad statistic. Seriously, stop. Thanks for asking."
Insurance,Does  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  Have  Life  Insurance?,"Blue Cross / Blue Shield is the name of the network association for a number of health insurance companies (includes Anthem and CareFirst). Many health insurance companies do also offer life insurance programs, however, it's typically not the type of coverage they specialize in and the products may therefore not be as competitive as insurance companies who feature life insurance programs as the main type of insurance they offer. Insurance companies specializing in life insurance tend to have more aggressive underwriting and can offer lower rates because they want to secure that type of business more than others. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
Insurance,What  Are  The  Advantages  And  Disadvantages  To  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The advantages of coverage in your senior years can be significant based on the average senior couple spending $250,000 in medical costs during their retirement years. The disadvantage is the loss of economic opportunity to invest or save the premium dollars spent on long term care insurance if you never use it."
Insurance,Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Life  Alert?,Medicare covers items that are considered medically necessary. This includes diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions caused by accident or illness. Medicare will also cover some DME (durable medical equipment) if prescribed by a doctor as part of your treatment plan. Services such as Life Alert are not considered medically necessary.
Insurance,Which  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?,"Product suitability is always a consideration when considering product lines that have such diverse application. Life insurance is generally purchased for indemnification or inheritance planning, but can be used as supplemental retirement income. Term life insurance is an excellent for temporary coverage for temporary financial exposure to your beneficiaries. For permanent liabilities, many planners use guaranteed universal life insurance. For supplemental retirement income there are several crediting methods: for interest rate crediting you can use participating whole life or current assumption universal life. If you desire access to domestic and/or foreign indices, you should review indexed universal life insurance. If your risk tolerance permits, you could consider variable universal life with access to separate sub accounts that use marker equities and bond instruments."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  HPV  Screening?,"Medicare covers your annual exams including most women's gynocological exams and testing. As part of your pelvic exam and pap test, your doctor should screen for abnormalities including STD's, abnormal cells and HPV. The HPV virus has been linked to certain types of cervical cancer. You should have regular HPV screening and it is normally covered by Medicare"
Insurance,Which  Is  The  Best  Life  Insurance  To  Get?,"The best life insurance to get is going to depend on many factors. The most prominent one being why are you taking out the policy. Otherwise, I would say a whole life policy is the one that will provide a lot of bang for the buck in most cases. To ensure that you get the policy that is right for you contact your local agent and discuss your needs and expectations so that they can direct you to the policy that best fits."
Insurance,How  Much  Should  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Cost?,"Long term care insurance premiums will vary greatly according to age, health, features of the policy, and area in which the policy is purchased. However, you could look at the federal guidelines for how much premium can be exempted on income tax returns, to get a general guide for life insurance premiums. In 2013, they are: 40 and under: $360/single, $720/couple 41-50: $680/single, $1,360/couple 51-60: $1,360/single, $2,720/couple 61-70: $3,640/single, $7,280/couple 71 and up: $4,550/single, $9,100/couple"
Insurance,How  Safe  Are  Fixed  Annuities?,"Tax deferred, fixed annuities are based on the contractual claims in the annuity policy. The contractual claims in the annuity policy are as good as the financial strength and claims paying of the annuity company that issued the policy. Generally, fixed interest rate annuities guarantee a rate for a period of time like 5, 7 or 10 years. The annuity insurance companys portfolio is generally dominated by government bonds."
Insurance,How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Settle  A  Life  Insurance  Claim?,"Life insurance death claims are generally filed by the beneficiaries of the policy. The beneficiaries contact the insurance company for their death claim forms and return them with an obituary and certificate of death. The process should take between 30 and 60 days. If the death occurred within the two year contestability period, a standard investigation will ensue which can delay payment."
Insurance,Is  Car  Insurance  Credit  Checked?,When you are applying for auto insurance coverage most if not all insurance carriers will do what is called a soft pull of an insured's credit score. This soft pull normally will not adversely affect a persons credit rating. Credit score is only one part of the many factors that are taken into consideration when your rate is calculated.
Insurance,Can  I  Use  HSA  To  Pay  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Yes, you can use HSA to pay for long term care insurance premiums. There is a limit on the premiums for LTC insurance that can be paid through your health savings account. The instructions for your Section A (Form 1040) of your tax return will tell you the limit of premiums that can be deducted for your age group that year."
Insurance,Can  Employers  Charge  Smokers  More  For  Health  Insurance?,"Yes. Application of a premium surcharge for tobacco users has become more common in recent years, primarily in larger groups who self-fund their employee benefits plans as the employer has much more control of the benefit plan design and rate structure than they do with fully insured plans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), while doing away with pre-existing condition exclusions, does explicitly allow for the adjustment of rates for tobacco use. So, in that sense, tobacco users are the class of employees it is legal to discriminate or penalize for their personal behavior. The ACA is silent on the consumption of Marijuana which may present some interesting situations as more states move to allow the use of medical Marijuana or to legalize its recreational use."
Insurance,What  Does  Home  Owners  Insurance  Usually  Cover?,"That's kind of a tough question to answer becuase many homeowners policies cover a multitude of things. In general terms if you house catches on fire, is broken into, is damaged by wind hail or lightning, your pipes burst, some body trips and falls on your proprty and gets hurt you could have a claims situation on your homeowners policy. This is just scratching the surface as every policy is different in every state. Most carriers add in a bunch of ""extra"" coverages too. To truly know what your homeowners policy covers, you need to do two things 1) Call you local independent agent and discuss you policy with them 2) Actually read your policy. I know reading a legal contract is your idea of fun night curled up by the fire, but it is in your best interest to actually read your entire policy, know what it includes and excludes and ask your agent about things you have questions on...."
Insurance,How  Much  Does  An  Ultrasound  Cost  Without  Health  Insurance?,Ultrasound exams are usually a few hundred dollars when you have health insurance. The Health Care Blue Book shows a price of $158 for an abdominal ultrasound including physician fees. Ultrasound on other body parts may be more or less. You should ask your doctor about costs in advance and negotiate an acceptable rate.
Insurance,What  Is  10  Yr  Term  Life  Insurance?,"That is a great question! A ten year term policy is one that provides you with the specified amount of coverage for the ten years as defined in your policy. On the day your policy expires, you have no more coverage, and no cash value or benefit to take from it. You can renew your policy, but it will dramatically increase in price. Typically a policy like this is to insure against a short term loss, like covering a college career, or a mortgage, or to provide a cheaper form of life insurance when money is tight. If you would like more details, please feel free to contact me, okay? Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,Can  You  Put  Money  In  A  401K  And  A  Roth  IRA?,"That is an excellent question! Not only can you, but you should! It is an excellent strategy to maximize as much as you can afford to the amount you can contribute to your retirement funds. Contribute as much as you can to the 401 to earn the employer match, it's free money, in a way, and you should take advantage of it. Your Roth will allow $5500 a year ($6500 if you are 50+) and after your 401, contribute as much of that as possible. The earlier you start, the better, and by maximizing your contributions now, it will help balance out when the time comes that money is a little tighter, and you can't contribute as much. Thank you for asking!"
Insurance,Can  I  Get  Health  Insurance  With  Hepatitis  C?,"You can purchase health insurance with Hepatitis C as a preexisting medical condition. There would be no waiting period before benefits begin, but time is quickly running out. The Affordable Care Act requires that health plans accept all applicants regardless of existing medical conditions. Applicants need to enroll in a plan during the annual open enrollment period through their state insurance exchange. The first open enrollment ends on March 31 of 2014 - in just a few days. Coverage would begin April 1. If you miss this open enrollment window you could enroll in plans with a January 1, 2015 effective date."
Insurance,When  Can  I  Enroll  In  Medicare  Part  A?,"You will automatically be enrolled in Medicare when you reach age 65 provided you have worked long enough and paid into the system. You will have the choice to opt out of part B of Medicare, but I do not recommend it unless you are still working and in a group. You will also get Medicare if you are on Social Security Disability. There is about a two year wait when you get disability before you are eligible."
Insurance,When  Did  Health  Insurance  Originate?,"That is a great question! There were some types of travelers insurances offered in the 1840's that covered you if your train crashed or steamboat sank, but other than that, there really wasn't much until the late 1800's when disability policies became popular. Britain passed a law in the early 1900's that created a ""National Health Insurance"", and most of Europe kind of adopted similar laws, but we didn't catch on until 1929 when us Texans ( Baylor University Hospital, and some local teachers, I think) created a system of standardized costs for hospital stays. Shortly thereafter came Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and then all kinds of competing companies. The history of insurance is interesting stuff. Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,How  Important  Is  Health  Care  Insurance?,"Very important. Health insurance allows people to go and get health care if needed. Typically people with insurance will get check ups, find problems sooner due to early detection and can address health needs proactively. When you don't have health insurance you spend your days praying you never get sick. If at all possible strive to keep health insurance on yourself and your family."
Insurance,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  To  Get  Renters  Insurance?,"Great question. Often clients are afraid to ask I think they believe is it expensive but actually its relatively inexpensive. Typically if you insure two vehicles with a company the discount you gain by having a second policy on your auto insurance will if not cover the cost of a renters policy it will be close! So the average cost is 60-120 dollars a year. So for ten dollars or less you have coverage for your phone, computers, books, clothes, medications, cd's, movies, art, guns or whatever else you own! Ten dollars a month is very inexpensive, also these are covered anywhere in the world!"
Insurance,Does  My  Home  Insurance  Cover  Theft?,"It is important to talk to your insurance professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy, but generally speaking, theft is a named covered peril in most Home Insurance policies. This would include theft of your personal property from within your home of course, but also includes theft of your property outside of your home. Personal property outside of your home is usually covered up to 10% of the total personal property amount listed in your policy. If covered, the loss settlement would be subject to your deductible. The claims specialist will also be looking for a copy or a police report."
Insurance,How  Does  Renters  Insurance  Benefit  The  Landlord?,"That is a great question! The landlord needs to provide a safe environment for the tenants, and carries insurance on the property. To help protect the property manager/complex from a higher liability, your renters policy helps take some of that liability off of their shoulders. If you damage the apartment, or someone is injured in your apartment, your policy covers some or all of that claim, and not the landlords. Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,Do  Ohio  Employers  Have  To  Offer  Health  Insurance?,"Employers in Ohio are required to offer health insurance to their workers although they can avoid any penalty if the family can not afford the healthcare benefits offered. Also, this penalty has been delayed until 2015 to give employers and insurers time to work on specific details of implementation. This tax penalty applies to companies with 50 or more workers and applies to workers and their dependents, including children under the age of 26. Technically, the law does not apply to spouses. ""Full-time"" would be considered working 30 hours per week. However, having 100 part-time workers working 20 hours per week would qualify as having 50 full-time workers. Here in Ohio, we have enjoyed low health insurance rates, and although required mandates will be raising premiums, there still will be many low-cost options.Most of the major insurers, including Anthem and Medical Mutual, will be participating in the State Health Exchange."
Insurance,How  Much  Auto  Insurance  Should  I  Have?,"I always recommend the highest limits of liability that you can afford. If you have a good insurance score, and a clean driving record, the premium difference between 50/100 (50k per person/100k per accident) and 100/300 will not be much relatively speaking. Also, it is a good idea to have a high limit of liability for property damage, such as $100,000. The national average vehicle liability award in 2008 was $326,628. That said, I always recommend at least 250/500 limits of liability. Additionally, I always recommend having an ""umbrella policy"" to increase your limits of liability. Ask your insurance agent for a quote on a $1,000,000 umbrella policy. Be sure to tell your agent of all properties or vehicles titled to you."
Insurance,Why  Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Increase?,"Homeowners Insurance is a contract whereby a homeowner transfers his/her risk to an insurance carrier in return for a contract and a small premium. Homeowners Insurance Premium will usually increase from year to year; however, by chance a decrease may be seen once in a while. Insurance companies increase the Dwelling Coverage each year to keep up with the increasing cost of reconstruction; after all, homeowners insurance's primary purpose is to rebuild a home in the unfortunate event of a total loss. The small increase of dwelling coverage each year is usually the purpose that draws attention when the premium rises; however, this is very insignificant. Insurance companies are audited each year and are obligated to comply with State Department of Insurance regulations in each and every State where they underwrite risk. Each year, insurance carriers calculate the necessary premium to maintain a safe financial condition and offer security to all homes insured; the largest reason for premium increase would be 'loss experience' during the prior year, another reason may be due to increased operational cost including but definitely not limited to reinsurance premium paid. Insurance Companies either have an internal actuarial department or hire an independent actuarial firm who are charged with the responsibility of calculating premium based on underwriting factors and prior loss data. For this reason, carriers only offer annual policies and are unable to predict risk on a longer term basis. Since carriers experience different loss results each and every year, insurance rates and increase percentages are never the same from one year to the next. Since paid losses continue to grow, claim frequency is showing growth and litigation is becoming more commonplace, insurance companies raise premium to keep up with the outflow of payments. It is important to recognize that claims and operational expenses are paid from the pool of collected policy premium. For a more detailed explanation or financial report from your current carrier, contact your carrier representative to receive a report. Also, data is available as published by the Department of Insurance in most States."
Insurance,Who  Can  Buy  Medicare?,"That is a great question! The vast majority of people get Medicare when they are turning 65. The program will allow people under the age of 65 to enroll under certain conditions, like kidney failure, or if you have been on disability for a designated amount of time. The program is designed to help Senior Citizens afford health care, so unless you meet the exceptions, you will need to be 65 or older to enroll. Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,How  To  Remove  Medicare  Part  B?,"--> Medicare makes it difficult to cancel, or withdraw from, Medicare Part B. Because Medicare Part B provides important coverage for most people 65 and older, and because there's a penalty if someone cancels Medicare but then later wants to enroll again, Medicare enrolls everyone automatically at age 65 and wants to make sure no one cancels their coverage without fully understanding the consequences."
Insurance,At  What  Age  Should  I  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The best time to secure long term care insurance is when youre young and healthy, especially if you have a family history of chronic illness or nursing home confinement. Most advisers begin addressing long term care insurance with their clients and prospects around age 50. But in reality, most pre retirees purchase long term care insurance in their early 60s."
Insurance,When  Are  Life  Insurance  Death  Benefits  Taxable?,"Typically, life insurance proceeds are not taxable. They pass on to the beneficiary tax-free and can be deposited into a pre-approved or pre-discussed account. Based on my 32 years of experience handling too many claims, the period of time is about 10-30 days for the check to arrive. In some circumstances, there could be estate taxes. Also, depending on the type of policy and how premiums were paid, there could be a taxable event. A full-time broker or financial planner is your best resource."
Insurance,What  Are  Medicare  Savings  Programs?,"Medicare Savings Accounts (MSA) is a specific type of Medicare Advantage plan that may or may not be available in your area. Similar to the HSA (health savings account) for major medical plans, the MSA combines a high deductible Advantage plan with a tax favored savings account. These are not for everyone but there are definite advantages."
Insurance,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Dog  Bites  To  Other  Dogs?,Dog bites would be covered under the liability portion of your homeowners policy. Dog bites have become a big deal over the last several years and dog bite can be a very expensive loss in some cases. For this reason many insurance companies have put exclusions on certain breeds of dogs and will not cover a dog bite. You would need to check with your specific insurance company to see if your breed of dog is covered should a dog bit occur. All agents should be having this discussion with the client before purchasing a policy.
Insurance,What  Does  Medicare  Plan  A  Cover?,Medicare Supplement Plan A is required to be offered by all insurance companies who offer Medicare supplement plans.

Medicare Supplement Plan A Covered Benefits: 1) Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up 2) Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3) First 3 pints of blood 4) Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment Benefits not covered: 1) Skilled Nursing Facility Care coinsurance 2) Medicare Part A deductible 3) Medicare Part B deductible 4) Medicare Part B excess charges 5) Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits) Medicare supplement plans can be purchased through an insurance agent/broker.
Insurance,Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Option?,"The answer to any financial question should always be prefaced by ""it depends on the need of the individual"". That said, there are significant benefits for someone who owns a whole life participating policy. Whole life, a form of permanent life insurance, features guaranteed premiums, death benefits and cash value. Whole life policies also give you the potential to receive dividends which can increase the value of the policy or provide an increased death benefit for beneficiaries. Unlike term, the death benefit will last your entire lifetime and the monthly premium will be locked in at the date of policy inception according to your ""rating"". So, if you are 35 and get rated ""Preferred Non-tobacco"" that will give you a monthly premium that will not change for your entire life, regardless of any health issues - as long as your premiums are current. The second important value of whole life insurance is the accumulation of cash inside the policy on a tax-deferred basis. Over time, the cash value increases can be significant and you can borrow cash from your policy at a favorable interest rate. Many people have used this as a source for college funding or even a retirement income stream later in life. These policy loans are generally tax free. There is a lot more to Whole Life policies that can be addressed when considering your personal situation and I would recommend contacting an independent insurance agent that can review your particular needs and situation."
Insurance,Can  Employers  Contribute  Different  Amounts  Health  Insurance?,"They can as long as they are not discriminating within a class of employees. For example, it is not uncommon for an employer to contribute on dollar or percentage amount towards the coverage of salaried employees and another dollar or percentage amount towards hourly employees. This is quite common where a labor union collectively bargained agreement is in place. Where an employer can get in trouble is where they choose to discriminate within the same class of employees. So, as a general rule all salaried employees should be treated the same from an employer contribution standpoint as should be the case with all hourly employees. Contributing 50% of the cost for one salaried employee and 75% of the cost for another similarly situated salariedemployee could be the grounds for a labor discrimination lawsuit for the employer."
Insurance,What  Will  Happen  To  Medicare  In  The  Future?,"Medicare is ""too big to fail"" but that does not mean there won't be changes. Funding and benefits will need to be adjusted in order for the system to survive. Medicare is like a balloon. You squeeze in one place and it bulges in another. Going forward, medical providers will have reimbursements squeezed, deductibles and premiums will rise. The biggest threat to Medicare beneficiaries is the Obamacare IPAB that will oversee medical treatment."
Insurance,Can  The  General  Life  Insurance?,I was not able to find a General Life Insurance Company. I did find General American Life Insurance which has been bought by Metlife Insurance.

Insurance,Will  My  Auto  Insurance  Go  Up  If  Get  Ticket?,That will depend primarily on your insurance carrier andyour previous motor vehicle record.

It's rare, but there are companies that offer coverage that may not include theft. This coverage form is called ""Basic Form"" and it will not cover theft. Never, never, never accept a policy written on a basic form for your renters coverage. The most common form is Broad Form, and it will cover theft. Most companies and agents will use this when writing your renters policy. Don't accept anything less."

Has the building been well cared-for? Claims Submission History - Ex: Does the prospect have a history of submitting claims on a frequent basis...especially smaller ones? Dwelling Location - Fire station proximity; History of frequent and /or severe losses in the area from wild fires, hurricanes, etc. Credit History - Credit score - Prevailing underwriting theory is that better credit scores equate to less possibility of frequent claim submissions. Additional Risk Factors - Swimming pools, with or without child safety devices; Questionable types of animals in terms of temperment, as relates to possible attacks on humans; Recreation equipment on premises - safety devices?"

It can be used for medical expenses, food, mortgage or anything else needed to survive during a difficult time."
Insurance,At  What  Age  Should  You  Get  Life  Insurance?,"Most people I talk to wish that they had bought their life insurance a few years ago. One man recently was kicking himself around the block for not doing so. Obviously, the older you are the closer the company is to the day that they will have to pay a death benefit. In other words, as you age you become a greater risk to the company and the company must charge more to compensate."
Insurance,Is  Travelers  Home  Insurance  Any  Good?,In my personal opinion Travelers home insurance is a superior product. Also Travelers has excellent customer service and claims handling.

Insurance,What's  Covered  In  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Let me add a few comments here on how the coverages are usually presented on a Declaration page of a Homeowners policy. First there is the party being insured and who the company is that is providing the insurance. Then there is a specific term for the coverage to begin and end. Then there are many ways to then itemize the coverage, but here are some basics. The policy is usually divided into two Sections .Section I deals with property insurance and Section II Liability Insurance, so within the section I coverages there are usually four parts Coverages A,B, C, D. Coverage A is the Dwelling Coverage. This can be sold on an Actual cash value basis ( very infrequently, but watch out for it ) usually on a 100 % of the dollar value of the estimated cost to replace the house itself. This is often difficult for consumers to understand, but no one really cares about the market value. What is important is the replacement cost and replacing one house destroyed is usually a lot more expensive then building one new in a subdivision. Make sure you have enough coverage. This is not an exact science so many companies offer extensions to increase the coverage beyond the stated value. Next is Coverage B : These are the other structures appurtenant, outbuildings, fences, Gazebos unattached garages etc. Coverage C is usually Personal Property or Contents Coverage. This is very important to understand :You want replacement cost coverage not Actual Cash Value, ACV. The easiest way to think of this is the ten your old large and 200 lb TV. The ACV is going to be next to nothing. There is no continuing interest in buying that type TV anywhere. But replacing it with a new TV with light weight plasma features is what you want. Coverage D is Additional Living Expense. This can be stated two different ways or a mixture of the two. Some companies list a maximum dollar limit available. Others list a maximum time limit and still others list a maximum time limit and dollar limit. This covers the additional cost of living elsewhere while your home is reconstructed. It can also come into play if a Governmental authority won't let you near your home for safety reasons ( i.e. forced evacuation form an impending hurricane).This coverage does not pick up the cost of things you would normally pay out of pocket, but the additional things and costs necessary to keep your household going while your home is repaired. The next set of coverages comprise Section II or liability coverage. Coverage E is very broad and covers such things as an injury to a child by your dog, or an inadvertent collapse of you deck with guests on it etc. Coverage E then is is sold in increments of 100,000 usually. The difference in price from say 300,000 to 500,000 is usually only a few dollars a year. If you have an umbrella policy, you may be required to carry a minimum of 500,000 in coverage. Coverage F is Medical payments coverage. This is usually quite nominal and is used to cover minor incidents where fault may not be much of an issue, but you feel obliged to pay for the medical bill. For example a neighbor picks up your mail for you while you are gone and trips on your garden hose. The injuries are not serious, but do require a couple stitches . The limit is low because the much more serious incidents would require negligence or absolute liability and would fall under Coverage E. I hope this helps. If you are in AZ.CA,TX, MO, or GA we'll be glad to assist you with placing your homeowners coverage."

Insurance,Why  Do  Guys  Pay  More  For  Car  Insurance?,"Car insurance rates are rarely a moral issue. If guys have worse driving records than young women, the company can ask many states to allow them to rate them separately. In California, that isnt an option. There are only a few rating factors in California and sex isnt one of them. That doesnt make insurance cheaper, it merely means that there isnt a distinction between male and female drivers in California."

An example of a price on a $100,000 value of the ""dwelling"" would be around $350-$500/yr depending upon claims, credit & location of the home."
Insurance,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  After  Breast  Cancer?,"The short answer is yes, you can buy life insurance after cancer. The type, amount and terms depends on the cancer itselfand how long you have been cancer free after your last treatment. To get into the standard ratings after breast cancer practically all carriers will want to see you cancer free for 10 years. Anything less than10 yearswill be a higher risk policy of either rated premiums or graduated benefits."
Insurance,How  Many  People  Use  Disability  Insurance?,"Outside of group disability benefit plans at work, individuals owning disability insurance is shockingly small when compared to the staggering statistical odds of a disability occurring once in your working lifetime causing you to be disabled an average of 30 months. Who has enough savings in this economy to cover that? Not many!"
Insurance,Who  Is  Covered  Under  Your  Auto  Insurance?,"This depends upon your state and your insurance carrier. I will first speak generally then about the Michigan rules. General: anyone who is a family member and living in your home is covered by your auto insurance. Anyone who is borrowing your car with your permission is covered. Those are the major general coverage. Michigan: no-fault insurance goes like this 1. owner of the car, 2. driver of the car, 3. someone in the car, 4. a household family member who has no-fault. The general trend in Michigan is to find someone with insurance and make a claim against it, to prevent a mini-tort. I hope this helps."
Insurance,What  Is  A  Medigap  Plan?,"Medigap plans (commonly referred to as Medicare supplement plans) are designed to help seniors who want high quality healthcare and are on Medicare, cover the gap between what hospitals and doctors charge for their services and what Medicare will pay.Health insurance is constantly changing, which can make finding the right plan for you very strenuous. Supplementing your Original Medicare coverage (Medicare Parts A & B) with a Medicare Supplement plan will help you create a very predictable expense structure for your healthcare and allow you to see any doctor you want that accepts Medicare. Any doctor that accepts Medicare will also accept your Medicare Supplement plan. There are 10 different Medicare supplement plans and they are all standardized, meaning a plan F from company A and a plan F from company B feature the EXACT same benefits. The 10 different plans available are plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N (a high-deductible plan F is also available that features a $2,140 deductible in 2014 - the trade-off being a substantially reduced premium). Each plan offers certain benefits some more comprehensive than others. Each plan must cover a core set of benefits (also known as the basic benefits). The basic benefits are: 1) Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up. 2) Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3) First 3 pints of blood 4) Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment There's a total of 9 benefits that can be secured. The other 5 benefits available under a Medigap plan are: 1) Skilled Nursing Facility Care coinsurance 2) Medicare Part A deductible 3) Medicare Part B deductible 4) Medicare Part B excess charges 5) Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits) Each plan features a different structure, Each plan covers a different combination of these 9 benefits (some of the plans feature coinsurance or copayments for certain benefits). If cost is not a major factor for you, Plan F will be the recommended choice because it covers all 9 benefits at 100% - it's the most popular plan by far. If you're looking to keep your costs down, but still have very comprehensive coverage, you may want to look at plans C, G, and N as well. When you're looking to buy a Medigap plan, you should consult with an independent Medigap insurance agent to review the plans in detail to see which one will best serve your needs, help you identify all of the carriers offering Medigap plans in your zip code, and which one will be able to offer the coverage to you at the lowest cost (the plans are standardized so the biggest difference between them is price - the benefits are exactly the same regardless of the carrier you have the Medigap plan through). I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,How  To  Add  A  Dependent  To  Health  Insurance?,"Dependent children can be covered under their parent's health insurance policies up to age 26. The main questions are the timing of your wanting to add this dependent to your coverage or if a change of life status event has occurred that allows for the addition of a dependent to your policy. If it's renewal time for your coverage then it's simply a matter of requesting the paperwork to add thedependent to your coverage. In the context of group health insurance plans it is quite likely that if it is outside of your plan's open enrollment period that a change of life status event will have to occur for you to be able to add your dependent to your coverage. The most common change of life status events are marriage, divorce, birth of a child, adoption of a child or loss of other health insurance coverage. If you had the dependent during your last open enrollment period and did not add them to your group's policy at that timeand there has been no change of life status event in the interim you will almost certainly have to wait until your group's next open enrollment period. Also, in one of the quirks of ObamaCare, spouses are not technically defined as dependents (I know, it doesn't make any sense but remember our politicians didn't read the law before they passed it). So, with health insurance rates rising sharply you are seeing more employers not providing spousal coverage, or allowing spouses to be covered only of they do not have coverage available through their employers (if they have one), or you may see an extra charge assessed for covering a spouse that has crappy coverage elsewhere. Just a word of warning regarding possible surprises you might encounter in wanting to add a spouse to your coverage."
Insurance,How  Long  Does  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance  Last?,"The general rule of thumb for long term disability is to age 65. However there are disability insurance companies that offer longer or extended coverage. Then theres Lloyds of London, a company the prices risk outside the convention insurance market, in this case disability for high risk insureds or older insureds."
Insurance,Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  Bad?,"The death rate is 100%. The question then is, when will it occur? Term insurance will provide coverage for a limited period to time. Whole life insurance will provide the same coverage for the lifetime of the insured. Unless you die within the period of coverage of the term policy, the whole life policy will always be a superior buy. Unlike the term policy, the whole life policy premium remains constant and the policy develops cash values that can be used for other purposes. The whole life policy doesnt increase in cost just at the time that you need it."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Average  Car  Insurance  Rate  In  Utah?,"Auto insurance is priced based on several variables including: The type of car covered The age, gender, and marital status of the insured The coverage amounts elected by the insured For this reasons it's difficult to say exactly what you'd pay for coverage in any specific state However it is potentially noteworthy that Utah ranks number 12 within the nation for cheapest states in which to purchase auto insurance. This statistic comes from Bankrate."
Insurance,Does  Great  West  Life  Cover  Travel  Insurance?,"The greatwestlife.com website says this about Travel Insurance: ""Our Global Medical Assistance group plan enhancement to your group healthcare plan is designed to provide worldwide assistance to travellers in emergency medical situations, wherever and whenever the need arises.""

Insurance,Does  Term  Life  Insurance  End  At  A  Certain  Age?,"Yes generally term insurance policies end or expire at a certain age. The exact age depends on the particular policy, but age 85 is common. Term insurance polices are often renewable and convertible. That means that they renew for a higher premium at the end of each term 10,20,or 30 for example. It also means that up tp a specified age you can convert them to a level premium permanent insurance plan that does not expire before you do. An independent life insurance broker representing several companies can help you find the right policy at the right price."
Insurance,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Firearms?,"Most insurance companies will have internal limits of $1000 for property coverage of firearms. If you are speaking about ""accidental discharge"" of a firearm that causes damage to something or someone I would need you to refer to your specific policy. In NY some companies will specifically exclude bodily injury from a firearm. Hope this answer helps."
Insurance,What  Is  Net  Asset  Value  Of  A  Mutual  Fund?,"The Net Asset value of a Mutual Fund is the fund's value per share market value. This is the price investor buy fund shares from the mutual fund company. It is calculated by dividing the total assets of the fund, cash stocks and other securities less any outstanding liabilities by the toal number of shares outstanding. The calculation is done daily based on closing market values.

For example, if you search for: retirement planner Halifax or retirement planning Halifax, my name, along with several others, will come up. You can use the same method to find Retirement Planners in your community."
Insurance,Which  States  Have  The  Best  Health  Insurance?,"There is no objective answer to your question. The term ""best"" means different things to different people. In general terms states that have more health insurance carriers offering their services will have more competition and more choices for consumers which may translate into lower average costs and more options than a state with more limited competition within its boundaries. But no one can really say, for example, that California has better health insurance than Florida, just that you will have different options and different price points (even from a national health insurance company like AETNA or CIGNA)."
Insurance,Why  Is  It  Important  To  Plan  For  Retirement?,"It's very important to plan for retirement. You need to pay yourself first, which is exactly what retirement planning is. Paying your self today will determine how you live tomorrow."
Insurance,How  Much  Disability  Insurance  Is  Enough?,"Typically disability insurance benefits are equal to a maximum of 60% of the insured's income. The maximum one can buy then is based on the annual income of the individual. If you can live comfortably on a lesser amount than 60% of what you earn, then you may consider buying a policy that would pay less than 60% of your earned income."
Insurance,What  Does  Rider  Mean  In  Life  Insurance?,"A life insurance rider works just like any contract rider. It is an extension to the contract that stipulates an additional obligation by one or both of the parties to the contract. Specifically to life insurance, this would be any benefit made available by the life insurer that is optional to the policy owner to select that is not part of the base policy features."
Insurance,How  Much  Do  You  Pay  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Your premium price tag depends on your gender, age, smoking status, health history, current medical condition and paramed exam results. Your premium price tag is also dependent on your behaviors like: motor vehicle violations, dangerous recreational activities and vocational hazards. A nonsmoking married couple in good health and both age 60 will pay around $300 a month for a long term care policy with an inflation rider for $7,000 of monthly benefit and total benefit of $420,000."
Insurance,What  Can  I  Claim  On  Renters  Insurance?,"There are two key words, damage and lawsuit. If you suffer damage and it is the result of a specified peril you can claim the loss of personal property up to the limits of the policy. The adjustment will be the cash value of the property lost minus the deductible. When you actually replace the property, there can be a further adjustment if you have replacement coverage If you are sued for property damage or bodily injury the renters policy will defend and pay judgment up to the limit of the policy (that is why it is so important to take the highest limit offered!)"
Insurance,What  Does  Health  Insurance  Rated  Mean?,"A rated health insurance plan is one that includes a premium surcharge or load. The standard or preferred rate is insufficient to support the risk presented by the individual applying for health insurance. In some cases the surcharge is temporary while some conditions may result in a permanent load. Examples of a temporary load include tobacco use or excessive weight. Once the individual has stopped using tobacco products for a designated time period, or weight loss has been achieved and maintained, the premium loads may be removed."
Insurance,How  Would  You  Calculate  The  Expected  Return  On  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Before you break out your HP12c calculator, consider this. Almost all proposals illustrate internal rate of return on both death benefit and cash values. If you have an existing life insurance policy you can order whats called an in force ledger and request the internal rate of return on both death benefit and cash values."
Insurance,Can  I  Get  Auto  Insurance  Without  A  Driver  License?,I would have to say no. Every auto insurance carrier that I am aware of requires a drivers license number of all drivers that are to be covered by a policy. For a carrier to take on a risk that does not have a drivers license and is not getting insurance to have their license re-instated would possibly be a very unprofitable thing for the company to do.
Insurance,When  Is  A  Person  Eligible  For  Medicare  Part  D?,"Eligibility to enroll in Medicare Part D is at the same time as one is eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A, B and C. This is usually age 65 or when one starts receiving SSDI. There are certain times when one can sign up for Medicare Part D. Visit this website for details: WEBSITELINK"
Insurance,Is  Auto  Insurance  A  Federal  Requirement?,"Auto Insurance is not a requirement mandated by Federal law, but instead is required by most if not all states as a condition of registering a car for use on public access roads and highways. Property and Casualty insurance, including car insurance is regulated by state authority as opposed to the Federal Government."
Insurance,Can  You  Get  Auto  Insurance  With  Bad  Credit?,"There are several non-standard insurance carriers that will not factor in your credit even for rating purposes. As many have mentioned, many companies will use it to factor your rates due to the likelyhood that a person with good credit usually will always pay on time and will remain a long term customer, of course there is always the exception and the customers who shop around each renewal either way."
Insurance,Does  HIPPA  Apply  To  Life  Insurance  Companies?,"Legally, life insurance companies to not have to adhere to HIPPA. However, most life insurance companies utilize an application that includes a HIPAA form that must be signed so that the life insurance companies can access your medical information and complete their underwriting process."
Insurance,How  Much  Does  Auto  Insurance  Cost  After  A  DUI?,"The increase that you experience in your auto insurance rates after an accident, ticket, or even a DUI can vary greatly depending on the insurance carrier that you are with. The change to your auto rates could vary anywhere from zero to two or three times your current rate or possibly more. Contact your local agent they should be able to advise you of the carriers current policy on rate changes for clients that experience a DUI."
Insurance,How  Much  Is  Insurance  When  Buying  A  Home?,"Lenders normally require a mortgage holder to provide hazard insurance to cover the lenders interest in the property. This is normally interpreted to mean, a homeowners policy. The amount of coverage requested by the lender does not necessarily match the replacement cost for the residence. In California the mortgage holder cannot be forced to carry insurance in excess of the replacement cost of the residence. Your insurance agent can compute the cost of the policy that you require."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Medigap  Policy?,"Your Medigap policy is designed to cover all Medicare approved Part A and Part B claims. Some plans, such as Medigap plan F, cover Part A and B deductibles and coinsurance. Other plans, such as plan G covers everything that is covered by F EXCEPT your Medicare Part B annual deductible."
Insurance,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  A  Lost  Engagement  Ring?,"Your renters insurance may provide some limited coverage for a lost engagement ring less your deductible. Many renters policies will provide limited coverage for jewelry, electronics, appliances, and other personal items. Please remember every policy is different. Read your plicy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be within."
Insurance,Does  Obamacare  Cover  Medigap?,"No, Obamacare does not cover Medigap, or any other Medicare related expenses. In fact, Obamacare actually calls for over $700 BILLION in cuts to the Medicare system over its first ten years, a budgetary item that places the benefits available to our country's senior citizens at tremendous risk. The benefits of Obamacare are only available to those under the age of 65, which basically equates to this law taking money away from caring for our nation's seniors to secure coverage for younger individuals, at least those younger Americans that do not make enough income to cover the cost of coverage themselves."
Insurance,How  Much  Is  Nationwide  Renters  Insurance?,"The cost of renters insurance from Nationwide will depend on several factors including the value of your items kept in the apartment or house, the location of the building, the age of the building, and your heating source within the building. Based on the variability of all these items, it's nearly impossible to answer this questions without more information about these items."
Insurance,Who  Sells  Mortgage  Life  Insurance?,"The lender that provides your home loan is typically the vendor that sells mortgage life insurance to you, as well. When death occurs, the lender is paid the benefit of the policy, so that their portion of your loan is paid off. Life insurance can be used to cover a mortgage, however. It is more competitively priced than mortgage insurance and the death benefit does not decrease as your loan decreases. The beneficiary is the person of your choice. They can use the money to pay off the mortgage, or else spend it on other things if it makes more sense to keep the mortgage."
Insurance,Does  My  Life  Insurance  Cover  Skydiving?,"When you applied for the life policy you probably had to indicate if you were involved in skydiving. If at the time that you completed the application you answered that truthfully and the company did not exclude skydiving from your policy, you are probably covered. If there isnt an exclusion for skydiving and the policy is more than two years old, you are probably covered. The statements on an application are representations and must be factually correct to the best of your knowledge."
Insurance,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  Skin  Removal  Surgery?,"It will depend upon your medical situation; 1) No Scenario (the most likely) - the skin removal is for cosmetic purposes. This is generally understood to extend to persons who have meaningful weight loss that leaves them with excess skin. So, you may have done the right thing by losing a lot of weight but you may have to reconcile yourself to living longer with a flabbier body or privately pay for cosmetic surgery. 2) Yes Scenario (uncommon but not rare) - where medically necessary criteria are met. There are circumstances where there can be recurring health problems caused by skin overhang (yeast infections, sores and rashes, infections, etc.) that can be remedied or mitigated by removing the overhanging skin, a Panniculectomy. This is not the same procedure as what is commonly referred to as a ""tummy tuck."" The Punniculectomy only removes the overhanging skin and does not address the stretching of abdominal muscle that can also occur and which is commonly addressed in the ""tummy tuck"" procedure. As such, depending upon the terms of your policy and how a claim is coded I can foresee the situation where both procedures are performed (if the doctors went on and did the more invasive abdominal muscle procedures while ""they were in there"" and this was done with your prior consent or request) and part of the procedureis covered by the policy and the other part being deemed for cosmetic purposesand not being covered."
Insurance,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  To  See  A  Dermatologist  Without  Health  Insurance?,"The cost of seeing a dermatologist without health insurance could cost between $50 and $500, depending on tests that are performed, the cost structure of the physician, the area where you live, and what special offers the physician gives to consumers without coverage. You can always ask in advance and ask if there is a ""break"" since you are not covered."
Insurance,Where  To  Get  Health  Insurance  With  A  Preexisting  Condition?,"Starting January 1, 2014 you cannot be denied coverage or charged more for health insurance on individual plans purchased either off or on the government's Marketplace Exchange. If you are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, those programs cannot refuse you either with a pre-existing condition. Open enrollment is now going on for these plans. The only exception is grandfathered health care plans that you purchase yourself, not through an employer. These plans must have been purchased on or before March 23,2010 and not have changed or reduced their benefits to the insured to be considered grandfathered plans."
Insurance,Does  USAA  Sell  Life  Insurance?,"USAA does indeed sell life insurance. USAA (United Services Automobile Association) is a Texas based insurance carrier founded in 1922 to serve the financial needs of past and present members of our armed forces. USAA life insurance plans can be very competitive in some situations. You should always compare rates to other carriers when shopping for life insurance. You should also factor in underwriting, which can significantly impact the final rate."
Insurance,Does  The  Federal  Government  Have  Disability  Insurance?,"Yes, the federal government has disability insurance called Social Security Disability Insurance. You pay into it when you pay your Social Security taxes. If you are 31 or older, you must have worked at least 5 of the last 10 years to qualify for SSDI benefits. If younger, the requirement is lower. You must also be determined medically disabled."
Insurance,What  Is  A  Life  Insurance  Unit?,"A life insurance unit is $1,000. Life insurance is priced per unit. So if you wanted to purchase a $500,000 life insurance policy that costs $2.00 per unit, the cost of the policy would be $1000 per year, plus policy fee. Most people do not see the unit price when purchasing life insurance, but buying a child rider is a time when the unit price is often shown and you are given the chance to pick how many units you want you want in the rider."
Insurance,How  Much  Is  Disability  Insurance  On  Average?,"On average, long term disability insurance costs 1% to 3% of the annual salary for men; slightly higher for women. There are many features to a Disability Insurance policy that can make it cost more. Some are important, some not so important. Most people will have to pick and choose to keep the Disability insurance premium within their budget but still get the important features."
Insurance,Can  You  Surrender  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"You certainly can surrender a policy for its cash value, but then you have no life insurance. It would be much better for most folks to just borrow money from their policy and either pay it back or not. With a surrender, you will have to pay tax, but with a loan you will not, even if you do not pay it back, and you would still have a smaller but existing life insurance policy. Pay it back later and the death benefit returns automatically to the full amount! Call me, Gary Lane, Agent, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thanks."
Insurance,Is  Life  Insurance  Considered  Income?,"No, life insurance is not usually considered income for income tax purposes. If you receive the death benefit in regular payments rather than a lump sum, the interest only will be considered income. There are some caveats to this, especially with cash value policies. But generally speaking, life insurance is not counted as income."
Insurance,When  Should  I  Get  Disability  Insurance?,"You should secure disability coverage as soon as you begin working full time. Disability insurance is paycheck protection. Most Americans have 90 days in cash reserves, so a disability could be financially devastating. The odds of experiencing a disability event are much higher than death, so its an important part of defensive planning."
Insurance,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  For  Renters  Insurance?,"Individual residences are unique. So are the premiums for renters insurance plans. Check with people who have similar units. Find out what their limits are, from that you can come pretty close to an estimate of what it might cost you. Contact an agent that you trust. Have them design a policy and then you will know exactly what one company will charge for the renters policy."
Insurance,Does  New  Hampshire  Require  Auto  Insurance?,"New Hampshire does not require you to have auto insurance. However, you are required, by law, to meet the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Requirements. If you can no meet these requirements, your license may be suspended. Sufficient funds must be available in case you have an accident that is your fault. The requirements are $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident and an additional $25,000 of property damage. $1,000 of medical payments coverage is required if the vehicle is for personal use. Most persons purchase car insurance policies. An experienced broker will provide the lowest available rates for you in New Hampshire from the best carriers."
Insurance,How  Much  Of  Your  Salary  Is  Covered  By  Disability  Insurance?,"Along with what Peggy said, it's important to note that you can always receive more benefit when you start making more money. Some people think, ""Oh, I don't want to buy it now because I'll be making more money in a few years."" Don't make that mistake! You can either add a future increase rider to your policy (to avoid medical underwriting), or you can just apply for a second policy when the time comes."
Insurance,Which  Pharmacies  Accept  Medicare?,"If you have a Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Plan), you should be able to call your Part D insurance company to find out which pharmacies are in your area that accept your Plan. Another way to find out which pharmacies accept your Medicare Part D plan is to visit medicare.gov and choose the tab that says Drug Coverage (Part D). Scroll to the bottom of the list and select Find Health and Drug Plans. You will now be on a page titled Medicare Plan Finder. Enter your zip code in the General Search box and click on the Find Plans button. You are now on a page that is Step 1 of 4.

It is in your best interest to call the pharmacy and make sure they accept your particular Medicare Part D plan before venturing out to fill your prescription."
Insurance,How  Long  Will  It  Take  To  Get  Car  Insurance?,If you have all of the information that is required by your local agent to get you a quote and you have the ability to pay the required downpayment you could have auto insurance coverage within minutes. When you go to see your local agent make certain that you have the vin numbers of the vehicle(s) that you are looking to cover and the driver's license numbers of the person(s) to be covered.

Medicare will pay for nearly all the expenses to care for someone at home when they have given up treatment for the illness causing their pending death. Medicare will pay for some medications and treatments that provide comfort.
Insurance,How  Do  You  Determine  Cash  Value  Of  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"The only type of term insurance that has a cash value is ROP Term. This stands for Return of Premium Term. About halfway through the term, it will pay back some cash if you surrender the policy. At the end of the term, it will pay back all the premiums you paid in. Keep in mind that the cash value of ROP term is not able to accessed unless you surrender the policy."
Insurance,Does  Life  Insurance  Pay  For  Your  Funeral?,"Life insurance can be used to pay for your funeral or for any other purpose for which your beneficiary uses it. If you purchase a life insurance to fund your final expenses, leave the death benefit to a beneficiary who knows your wishes, or you can even leave it directly to the funeral home."
Insurance,How  Long  Can  You  Keep  A  Child  On  Your  Health  Insurance?,One of the first changes to come from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) when it was passed in March of 2010 was to extend the period of time that a child could be covered as a dependent under their parent's major medical insurance. Children can be covered under their parent's health plan up to age 26. The child does not have to be dependent uponthe parent and it does not matter if the child is employed and has coverage available through their job or if they are married and could be covered under their spouse's health insurance.
Insurance,When  Is  Health  Insurance  Tax  Deductible?,"Generally a self employed person is able to deduct health insurance if he or she pays the premium. There are other circumstances where health insurance can be deductible, such as a person paying there own premium and is able to file long form itemizing deductions. Tax laws change so be sure to check with your tax adviser."
Insurance,What  Does  Suze  Orman  Say  About  Variable  Annuities?,"Suze has a nice piece online entitled Truth About Annuities. She devotes a lengthy paragraph to variable annuities. She lays out the basics of variable annuities with a slight negative undertone, a disparaging down her nose expose. There are some contentions in her paragraph worth a rousing conversation."
Insurance,Can  I  Pay  Health  Insurance  Premiums  With  Fsa?,"Can you pay health insurance premiums with a Flexible Spending Account? I guess the first thing I would ask is if you have a FSA in place, aren't your premiums already being deducted pre-tax? I don't know of any business situation that offers a FSA plan that doesn't already have employee paid premiums already taken pre-tax. Do you mean health insurance premiums for another family member who is not part of your employer's plan? I believe the answer would be no. FSA in regard to medical, dental and vision expenses are designed to pay towards out of pocket expenses a person has during a plan year."
Insurance,Does  Walmart  Take  Medicare?,"Walmart does accept Medicare Part B. Qualified Medicare recipients can purchase durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and other items covered by Medicare Part B in the Walmart pharmacy area. Walmart also is a participating provider in most Medicare Part D plans, and you can purchase drugs covered under Medicare Part D in a Walmart pharmacy."
Insurance,Can  Auto  Insurance  Be  Transferred?,"Generally, an insurance policy cannot be transferred or assigned. Every personal auto policy I can remember reading prohibits assignment of the policy without the written consent of the insurance carrier. That makes sense because the carrier has a right to choose their customers and since it is their money providing the coverage, they have a right to consider any change of risk. As a general rule it makes more sense for a new policy to be written because even if the carrier consents to the change the new insured inherits the record of that policy including all the claims and payment history. If the coverage is being transferred between a spouse to another spouse after a death, the companies are not in the habit of denying the request to change the first named insured. Otherwise, per the ISO Personal Auto Policy, ""Assignment of this policy will not be valid unless we give our written consent."" The answer is no but there is a pathway to a ""yes"" if the carrier consents in writing."
Insurance,What  Does  SR22  Insurance  Cover?,"An SR22 is nothing more than an administrative trail of the status of your auto insurance coverage. The form is filed because the State licensing agency has determined a need to be aware of the status of your coverage, usually due to failing to have insurance or having committed any of several offenses of driving laws. An SR22 is merely attached to your insurance record and your carrier agrees to submit status updates to your state bureau of motor vehicles. An SR22 does not provide any coverage."
Insurance,Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  Without  A  Job?,"Yes, as long as you are able to pay your premiums on time. I am not aware of a carrier that asks for a persons employer name or even employment status when they are applying to receive automobile insurance coverage. If you are able to make your insurance premium payments on time the insurance carrier will more than likely provide you coverage for as long as you wish to be provided coverage."
Insurance,How  Often  Do  You  Pay  Health  Insurance?,"That is a great question! As a rule, most insurance premiumpayments are paid on a monthly basis. Some, like your auto or life insurance policies, can also be paid on a quarterly, semi-annual (every six months) or annually. Health insurance though, as a rule is typically a monthly payment, though your provider may also allow for other payment schedules. Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,When  Does  The  Beneficiary  Collect  From  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"The beneficiary collects from a life insurance policy after the insured person dies.

Insurance,If  I  Don't  Have  Auto  Insurance  Can  I  Rent  A  Car?,"Car rental agencies offer insurance coverage for the duration of the rental period. Check with them as to coverages and premiums.

Insurance,When  Is  Home  Warranty  Insurance  Required?,Home Warranty is not required but I highly recommend it. Home Warranty is different from homeowners in that it can cover to fix or replace equipment in your home such as your HVAC Systems or pool equipment. In most cases the warranty company will continue to fix the item before replacing and this process can be extremely time consuming and frustrating. Be sure to research the companies so that you can get a good idea of how they treat these claims

Insurance,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Do  I  Need?,"Video Transcript: Today's question is, ""How much life insurance do I need?"" Well, you need to take all your financial obligations in indebtedness, all your future obligations like college, retirement, other areas that you think that you want to talk about or even charitable intent. You need to take all those totals, plus the loss of income. Because if I'm not there to generate income, what happens to my spouse or my family? I need to be able to generate income for them to live on. So what I'm looking at, all the ideas of ""How much do I need?"" I want to take all these areas into consideration; financial indebtedness, future obligations, maybe some charitable intent, and to replace the income from the person who's died.

Insurance,Is  Property  Insurance  The  Same  As  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Homeowners Insurance is a form of Property Insurance. The Insurance Services Office publishes Insurance Forms which are basic coverage contracts sold asinsurance policies by insurance companies. Homeowners Insurance is the most common form of Property Insurance; this form is generally written for Owner Occupied Single Family Homes but in some cases, it could apply to an Owner Occupied Duplex. To complicate matters further, mortgage companies do not differentiate the coverage form; they simply define required insurance as 'Hazard Insurance'; the hazard being the risk or collateral against which the mortgage company has leant funds. If a single family home is owner occupied, a Homeowners Insurance Policy should be purchased; if a 1 - 4 unit dwelling is tenant occupied, a Landlords Insurance Policy should be purchased. For residential apartments with 5+ units, a Commercial Form is required and in many cases can be written as a Residential Apartment Policy under a Business Owners Policy (BOP) package. For further clarification on the correct form of insurance, contact your insurance carrier or our office and we'll be happy to answer any further questions."

There are only a couple of companies that offer individual short term disability insurance. Many more offer individual long term care disability insurance."
Insurance,Does  Long  Term  Disability  Cover  Medical  Insurance?,"Long term disability and medical insurance are two completely different animals. Long term disability replaces a portion of your income during the time you are unable to work at your full time occupation due to a covered accident or illness. Claims payments are made directly to the insured. Medical insurance is designed to pay a portion of the medical bills derived from care you receive from doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Claims payments are made directly to the providers unless assigned elsewhere."
Insurance,What  Does  Loss  Of  Use  Mean  For  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Often referred to as COVERAGE D, Loss of Use is coverage on your homeowners insurance that covers the cost of losing the use of your home. For example, a fire in your home has caused significant fire & smoke damage, making the house unlivable until repairs are complete. You would need to temporarily move out - maybe to a Residence Inn or hotel. The cost for food, hotel, etc would be covered under loss of use.Most policies have some limit beside COVERAGE D, butif your policy indicates ""ALS"", which is Actual Loss Sustained, this is the broadest coverage."
Insurance,Does  Car  Insurance  Go  On  Your  Credit  Report?,"When you apply to buy insurance, most insurance companies will take your credit into consideration. It is considered a ""soft hit"". It will show up on your credit history that there was an inquiry, it doesn't change or effect your credit. So whatever your credit score was before you apply for insurance is what it will be after applying. To my knowledge, California is one of the states that mandates insurance companies not take a person's credit history into consideration when rating the premium. You can check with an insurance agent or broker licensed in your state to see if your state as the same rules."
Insurance,How  To  Drive  A  New  Car  Home  Without  Insurance?,Do not drive your new car without insurance. If you have a policy in place that covers physical damage you should be automatically covered long enough to call your agent and notify them of the new vehicle. Otherwise you are driving uninsured which is not only breaking the law but risking a potential cost you can not pay. A dealership if they are doing their job will not let you off the lot without first verifying you have an insurance policy in place.

Normally, the concern of the landlord is in the concern over legal action."

Insurance,What  Is  The  Difference  In  Medicare  And  Medicaid?,"Medicare is a taxpayer financed, government run health insurance program mostly for those age 65 and older.

This assumes you do not have a ""graded benefit"" policy, which will pay less than the full benefit if death occurs in the first couple of years."
Insurance,Why  Do  You  Need  Disability  Insurance?,"If you were injured in an accident or had a debilitating illness that prevented you from working, how long can you go without a paycheck? How will you pay your bills? How will you pay for your health insurance? Most people do not have enough in savings to pay the bills in the event of an extended illness. If they do, chances are it will come at the expense of the kids college fund or retirement savings."
Insurance,When  Does  Health  Insurance  Become  Mandatory?,"You will have to buy a health insurance plan by January 1st 2014 or pay taxes that are a part of the Affordable Care Act (aka: ObamaCare).

Insurance,Does  Getting  Married  Affect  Auto  Insurance?,"Yes, in most cases. Rates for married vs single are different amoungst most companies. How it will affect your rates is unpredictible because it depends on whether or not you were residing in the same household over the last year for starters. In Wisconsin at least if you reside in the same household you must be listed on each others policies if separate insurance is carried. To know exactly how getting married would affect your rates, I would suggest contacting your local agent to discuss it with them."
Insurance,Will  The  Cost  Of  Medicare  Go  Up  In  2014?,"The cost of Medicare will almost certainly go up in 2014. The cost of health care is rising, the population is aging and not getting any healthier. In addition, utilization of medical services continues to rise at a staggering rate. Unless Congress yields to political pressure, you should anticipate your Medicare Part A and Part B deductibles to rise along with your Part B premium. The only remaining question is, how much will these costs rise?"
Insurance,How  Long  Does  Car  Insurance  Last?,"The automobile insurance policy has a start date and expiry date. Claims arising from the operation of the vehicle between those two dates and times are covered. Occasionally a company will reinstate a policy that has passed beyond the expiry date. To do so they will almost always require a statement that there werent any potential claims during the period from the expiry date and the date of reinstatement. In those cases the policy will often be back dated to provide continuous protection. This is important when there is a loss payee, such as a bank, that has the authority to order coverage for the vehicle."
Insurance,Is  AAA  Home  Insurance  Any  Good?,AAA is an A rated insurance provider and offers a good homeowners policy. I always recommend when shopping for homeowners insurance that you do your research and check several companies as there are different policy types with coverage's and exclusions that you will want to look at. An independent insurance agent is an excellent resource who can help you navigate through all the details of policy offerings.
Insurance,Can  I  Keep  Insurance  Money  From  Car  Accident?,"As a general rule you can keep proceeds from your auto insurance. You can also spend that money as you see fit.

Insurance,Can  You  Get  Health  Insurance  As  A  Real  Estate  Agent?,"My sick sense of humor almost tempts me to say ""No, real estate agents are specifically excluded from getting health insurance by law"" but I won't do that. Yes, you can get health insurance. What you do for a living has no bearing on your eligibility for health insurance, especially now that ObamaCare is in full effect regarding guaranteed issuance of policies. In my experience, most real estate agents are self-employed/1099 contractor status people and not W2 employees of an agency. So, this probably means that you will need to get individual health insurance either through your state's government health insurance marketplace or outside of it. So, just like you would tell those ""For Sale By Owner"" folks, you need to seek out an experienced health insurance agent who can assist you in obtaining coverage. If you have been without health insurance for more than 60-days and haven't had what is called a ""change of life status event"" (marriage, divorce, childbirth/adoption, loss of other coverage) then you are in a time frame where you would be ineligible for enrollment in true major medical insurance until the next annual open enrollment period begins on November 15th, 2014 and the earliest your coverage could go into effect would be for January 1st, 2015. I hate to be the one to deliver this news but that is how ObamaCare works. Your only coverage option to carry you through until then would be to take out a Short Term Medical insurance plan. There are a variety of short term medical plan options available. However, you need to be aware that short term medical plans do still use limited underwriting questions, can decline a person for coverage and they do not cover pre-existing conditions. Please feel free to contact me if you need advice or assistance in this matter."
Insurance,When  Is  Open  Enrollment  For  Medigap  Policies?,"You can apply for a Medigap plan up to 3 months before your Medicare Part B effective date - you must have both Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B to buy a Medigap plan. Once you have an established Medicare Part B effective date, you will have a 6-month open enrollment period to buy any Medigap plan from any carrier with NO medical underwriting. After this point, you can buy a new Medigap plan whenever you would like (there are no annual enrollment periods for Medigap plans), however, you would have to go through medical underwriting if you don't qualify for a special enrollment period or a guaranteed-issue right. The best overall time to buy will be your initial open enrollment period when you're new to Medicare and just starting Part B coverage. Determining which Medigap plan is right from you and which carrier to apply for the plan through can be a bit more involved than some may realize. It's not all about price as some may believe. You need to look at the carriers' premium rating methods (community, attained, or issue age rated), their rates, their rate increase history, their service history, and other factors. It's best to consult with an experienced Medigap broker who can help you determine which plan and carrier will be most suitable to your desires, needs, and budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including providing quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."

Insurance,How  Much  Would  Car  Insurance  Cost  For  A  Ford  Mustang?,"In order to answer that question an agent would need to know the year, make and model of the Mustang. The coverage's desired. Who is the driver or drivers which would include date of birth and drivers license number. After obtaining this information a quote can be obtained. I don't have to state the obvious but a base model Mustang and a Salene Mustang will have completely different rates. Also a 50 yr old driver vs. a 20 year old driver will have a difference in rate not to mention the driving record."

The column that is usually titled ""Account Value"" is the cash value that is usually used by the carrier to determine the amount of loanable money the policyowner may borrow. 2. When the cash value in the ""surrender value"" column equals the ""Account Value"", it indicates that the surrender period or charges are no longer part of the cash value equation. However, if a loan is still outstanding, the surrender charge period could be over, but the loan would be reflected in a surrender charge lower than the account value."

Insurance,Where  Can  I  Buy  Health  Insurance  For  An  Individual?,"You can buy health insurance from an experienced broker and their website (perhaps your best option) or the .gov website, where you may talk to a newly-hired and inexperienced worker.

Insurance,When  Can  You  Disenroll  From  A  Medicare  Advantage  Plan?,It is best to look at the open enrollment period for the smoothest transition.

These plans are not intended for members to jump into and out of them but there is always an option to get out and return to a traditional medicare plan.

Insurance,Does  Life  Insurance  Go  To  Estate?,"If you choose the beneficiary of your life insurance policy to be your estate, or if none of your beneficiaries are alive when you pass, your life insurance proceeds will go to your estate. Other than those circumstances, your policy proceeds go to the person or other entity that you chose to be your beneficiary, bypassing your estate. This allows the benefit to not be tied up in probate and avoids unnecessary fees. However, the value of your life insurance is considered part of your estate value. If the total value of your estate is over the federal or state exempted amount, and if your spouse has passed, estate taxes on the excess may apply."
Insurance,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Rodent  Damage?,"Homeowners insurance excludes damage caused by insects, pests, and vermin.

Insurance,When  I  Can  Withdraw  Money  From  My  401K?,"Most people would want to wait until they are at least 59 1/2 years old to withdraw money from their 401k because that is the age when penalty free withdrawals can be taken.

You terminate employment through permanent layoff, termination, quitting or taking early retirement in the year you turn 55, or later. Pay for medical care up to the amount allowable as a medical expense deduction in the same year as the medical expense was incurred. Your withdrawal is a response to a qualified domestic relations order. You are required to begin 401k withdrawals by April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn 70 1/2.

Insurance,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Scooters?,"I believe you will find that for the most part, property plicies will exclude any motor powered vehicles from coverage.

Insurance,Can  You  Buy  Car  Insurance  With  A  Suspended  License?,An individual with a suspended license can purchase auto insurance.

The residents of the household will be required to be added to the policy as operators.
Insurance,Why  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  More  For  Men?,"Life insurance costs more for men simply because men die sooner than women on average, according to actuarial tables. The difference in rates between men and women is not as much at younger ages and for short term insurance. It is in longer term and permanent policies, and policies purchased at an older age, where the price increases for men show up more. That is because the policy is insuring the male to an older age, and the chances of mortality are higher."
Insurance,What  Is  A  Endowment  Plan  In  Life  Insurance?,"Endowment plans are designed to really push the cash accumulation inside your policy. Why would you want to do that? I mean after all, the purpose of life insurance is to provide the survivor benefit you need, when it is needed, for the best price available. Each dollar of benefit literally costs pennies. It is a great deal. So how does cash fit into this picture? It can be superb icing on the cake. Solid whole life products provide great guarantees on the cash accumulation. Solid whole life companies provide some hefty dividends on a non-guaranteed basics. Universal life can provide not only attractive cash accumulation, but some pretty interesting distribution options. And according to current tax law, all this money can be available with little or no taxation. (Ask your attorney if you dont believe me). BUT certain rules have to be followed if you want to keep Uncle Sam out of the picture. An endowment contract could very well trigger a taxable event. When a policy endows, it could exceed the threshold of growth that the government authorities allow before they tax you. A pretty good sign this has occurred is when the cash value equals the death benefit. Is this necessarily bad? It doesnt have to be. If you get the proper advice from your broker and your tax advisor, this could be a planned event in which you still benefit. Even considering the tax you will have to pay, you could still be way ahead of the game financially. However, if you really want to avoid a taxable event, your insurance company will help you. They really dont want to be sued by you or anybody else who mistakenly gets a tax bill you dont want to pay. They will give you illustrations to your hearts delight with all kinds of red flags screaming endowment! endowment! endowment! You can then plan accordingly. To endow, or not to endow. That is the question :)"
Insurance,How  Much  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  For  Seniors?,"The cost of life insurance for seniors is much higher than for persons in their 20's and 30's, because the mortality rates for seniors are much higher than for young adults. However, if you are a senior person in good health, or with a very well controlled health condition, there are companies that will cater to you. E.g. Getting type 2 diabetes at age 70 could enable you to still get Preferred rates with a few companies, whereas that would not be likely if you got type 2 diabetes at age 20. If you are a senior in good health and you want more coverage than just for your funeral, it can be worth it to use a medically underwritten policy. But be prepared to have an EKG, answer simple questions to test memory (e.g. who is the president of the US), and have all your medical records reviewed. Using an agency that specializes in senior life insurance can help you jump all the hurdles to get your best rate. For small, no exam final expense policies, the rates for seniors will depend a lot on your age and whether you are male or female.

Insurance,What  Happens  When  I  Cancel  Life  Insurance?,"When you cancel your Life Insurance policy, you are not only giving up the coverage you purchased but you may also be giving up your insurability and cost of insurance. When you applied for the coverage you are considering cancelling, you went through underwriting to determine if you are ""insurable"". While you are insured, if your health was to deteriorate, the insurance company still maintains the coverage you have. If after cancelling your policy, your health starts to suffer, then when you try to reapply for another Life Insurance policy, you may not be insurable and at best you will have to pay more in premium. Plus consider you will be older which also increases your premium. I recommend that you talk to your broker/agent first to discuss your situation and see the alternatives you have."
Insurance,What  Happens  If  I  Cancel  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"If you cancel a life insurance policy, first and foremost, the policy will not pay a death benefit to your beneficiary if/when you pass away. If the policy is Term insurance, there is no cash value to collect and no surrender charge to pay, no matter when you took out your policy. However, if you took it out within the year, your agent may lose all their commission from that sale and could be penalized by the insurance company. With Whole or Universal Life, there will be a surrender charge that reduces the cash value you would collect upon cancelling your policy. However, you may be able to roll your full cash value over into a new policy. Or you may have the option to change your policy to a reduced paid-up policy, in which you get to keep some death protection even though you are no longer paying a premium. Discuss your options with your agent; you may be surprised at the options you have."

Insurance,Can  An  Illegal  Immigrant  Get  Car  Insurance?,"The short answer is it depends upon the state. One of the most basic principles of insurance is a person/company must have an insurable interest in the property. In order to have an insurable interest in an automobile a person must have a valid drivers license and sometimes a registration. If a state allows an illegal immigrant to obtain a drivers license, then that person can obtain auto insurance. If the person cannot obtain a drivers license from that state, he cannot obtain auto insurance and even being behind wheel is illegal. Political debates aside, an illegal immigrant should find a state where he/she can register for a drivers license and get auto insurance. This not only benefits them because they will get property and liability coverage, but it will also benefit other drivers because it provides them something to recover from in the case of an accident."
Insurance,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Sump  Pumps?,"Not unless they are damaged by a covered peril. At that point they would be consider part of your personal property.

Insurance,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Groundwater?,"Generally speaking, no. However, it is always important to check with your Insurance Professional about the particular points in your Homeowners policy. Some company's policies may include coverage for damage caused by the failure of a sewer or drainage system. This can include anything from a sump pump to a curtain drain to gutters and downspouts. There would still need to be a determination by a claims professional as to the source of the water."
Insurance,Can  You  Get  Auto  Insurance  Over  The  Phone?,"It is possible to get an auto insurance quote over the phone, but to secure coverage the carrier will more than likely require you to meet with an agent to sign the application and verify that all of the information on the poliy is correct.

Insurance,Is  It  Mandatory  To  Apply  For  Medicare  At  65?,"If you are receiving Social Security benefits at age 65, you will be signed up for Medicare Part A and Part B automatically. When you get the packet in the mail, you will have a form that you can use to turn down Part B. At this time you can also opt out of Part A, but it is free and covers very expensive hospitalization costs, so you would be advised to keep it, or have very other good health insurance if you turned it down. If you are not yet receiving Social Security benefits at age 65, it is not mandatory to apply for Medicare Part A or B at that time. However, it is again, advisable to at least get Part A."
Insurance,What  Type  Of  Retirement  Plan  Is  Based  On  A  Formula?,"All group retirement plans that are covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA are based on some formulaic process.

Highly compensated employees are employees who earn over a certain amount in annual income, as of 2013 that amount is $115,000."
Insurance,What  Happens  If  I  Lie  On  A  Life  Insurance  Application?,"Not being truthful on a Life Insurance application could, at the very least, delay the application process, but that would be the least of your concerns. If you lie, as you say, on the application, and if for some reason, that gets through the underwriting process and the policy is issued, then the real conseqence could affect your beneficiary. If you die within the first two years of the policy, and the misinformation is discovered, the company very well could outright deny any claim. Bottom line, don't lie on any insurance application. The odds are with today's modern underwriting technology, you aren't going to get away with it."
Insurance,Can  Life  Insurance  Companies  Check  Medical  Records?,"Yes, absolutely they can. When you fill out an application, you give them permission to check your medical records, and unless your policy is extremely small, they certainly will check those records.

If necessary, drop the amount, so long as you have coverage for your family. Thank you. GARY LANE."
Insurance,How  Long  Does  A  DUI  Affect  Life  Insurance?,"This will vary from carrier to carrier. It will also depend on the number of DUI's you've had and your age.

Some of the most important factors are your driving record (including other family members), your zip code or county, your age, the type of vehicle you drive, your credit history, how the vehicle is used and the types of coverage you carry.

Insurance,Why  Should  You  Have  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Retirement planning is paying yourself. Disciplined despots into a retirement plan from every paycheck, no matter how small can help you develop a habit that you'll appreciate when you retire.

Insurance,Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Cover  Maternity?,"In order for a Disability Insurance policy to pay for time off from work due to maternity or childbirth, it must be a Short Term Disability policy.

COBRA used to be the best option if you had a pre-exisitng condition but under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, you can purchase individual coverage with no issues. You have to prove that you have a qualifying event under the IRS code which is a letter of Creditable Coverage from your former health insurance company or employer."
Insurance,Does  Life  Insurance  Get  Taxed  At  Payout?,"The death benefit from life insurance is usually paid out tax free if it is paid directly to the beneficiary(s). If it goes through the estate (no human beneficiary named) it will usually be taxed. If you are planning a larger estate, you will want to involve an estate planning attorney, a life insurance agent and a CPA as your advisory team. There are certain situations where you may be taxed if you do not plan well. A big advantage of whole-life insurance is that you can also use it for tax free income before you die. Life insurance is one of the most tax favorable money management tools you have available."
Insurance,Who  Is  The  Cheapest  Car  Insurance  For  New  Drivers?,"The cheapest car insurance for any driver is the policy that is in force and pays the claim when an accident occurs, regardless of the premium. In California an inexperienced driver is assigned to one of the cars in a household. That makes the premium for that vehicle increase substantially. Avoid the temptation to eliminate or reduce coverages to lower the premium. That could make your auto insurance the most expensive if it will not pay a claim or will not make you whole."
Insurance,What  Does  Medigap  Pay  For?,"Medigap, also known as Medicare supplement insurance, covers a portion of the balance of approved Medicare Part A and Part B expenses. Medigap plans are standardized and assigned letters. All Medigap plans with the same letter are identical in every way, except the premium. Medigap plan F pays 100% of the balance of approved Medicare Part A and Part B expenses."
Insurance,Why  Is  Men's  Car  Insurance  Higher?,"Insurance companies base their pricing on mounds of historical data. They carefully review statistics common to the industry as well as those specific to that company's loss experience. This risk analysis ultimately results in the rates we pay for the products that company offers. Over a great many years, statistics have tended to show that younger less experienced male drivers tend to be involved in more claims than their young, less experienced female counterparts. That being the case, and all other things being equal, it would cost more for a male to insure a car than it would for a female to insure the same car."
Insurance,Can  I  Rent  A  Car  From  Enterprise  Without  Insurance?,If you do not have your own insurance policy to protect you when you rent a car you do have the option to purchase the insurance provided by the rental car company.

Keep in mind the insurance provided by the rental car companies are generally state minimumcoverage's.
Insurance,Can  Car  Insurance  Companies  Drop  You?,"Yes, if you do not pay your premiums or no longer meet the carriers standards the carrier can either cancel or non-renew your policy typically with as least fourteen days notice. Contact your local agent to discuss the details of the drop notice. They may be able to help you understand the reasons behind your coverage being dropped or non-renewed."
Insurance,What  Is  Long  Term  Health  Insurance?,"I am going to take a stab at this as I am not quite sure what the question is. Health Insurance is not necessarily long term unless you have it for a long time however you may switch between different plans.

Pays for Nursing Home & Care programs, assisted living situations, in-home support and more."
Insurance,Is  Homeowners  Insurance  Increasing?,"That is a great question! Unfortunately, they probably are. The price for homeowners depends in part upon the cost of building and repairing homes near you, so as construction costs rise, so do premiums. The price can also rise if a number of claims have been filed near you, and if the company is trying to recapture lost profits. Your best bet is to contact a local agent who can help you compare prices, and see if there is one that might be more affordable. You can always gamble and raise your deductible also. Thank you for asking!"
Insurance,What  Is  A  Retirement  Plan  Fiduciary?,"Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 requires employer sponsored plans to accept fiduciary responsibilities for compliance under 404c and the newest regulation for fee disclosure, 408(b)(2).

Insurance,How  To  Withdraw  Cash  Value  From  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"First be sure you have a cash value life insurance policy. For example a whole life, universal life, indexed universal life or variable life, but not a term life which has no cash value. Locate in your policy the illustrations page. Depending on the years of accumulation you will see the cash value of the policy. You may ""borrow"" against the cash value at a very low interest rate and keep your coverage in force. Or you may cancel your coverage and receive the full cash value amount which is income tax free in most cases. Simply, call the insurance company and ask for the proper form to be sent to you in order to execute the transaction. However, before doing the later, be sure to have alternative coverage in place unless you are fortunate enough not to have a need for life insurance in the future."
Insurance,What  Is  Retirement  Survivors  And  Disability  Insurance?,"Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is a reference to three of the benefits that Social Security pays to those who have paid into Social Security taxes.

And the ""disability"" part refers to Social Security Disability benefits disabled persons receive if they are qualified."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Exclusion  Ratio  In  Annuities?,"The exclusion ratio usually refers to taxation of the payments or proceeds. What they do is take what you paid in, divided by what you are paid out. This will come up with a percentage ratio.

Consult with a tax professional to see how this may apply to your individual situation."
Insurance,What  Does  Disability  Insurance  Mean?,"Disability insurance is just that! It covers you should you be unable to perform your job due to an accident or illness.

When selecting a disability plan make sure you choose ""own occupation"" over ""any occupation."""
Insurance,Can  An  Annuity  Be  Rolled  Into  A  401K?,"If youre addressing existing non-qualified annuity and you desire to use in funding an 401(k), the following cautions are advised. Your name may be the same on the annuity as well as the IRA, but it reality, your changing ownership registration. If that happens your annuity, if effect, is being surrendered and that surrender will trigger an ordinary income tax event on the gain in the policy. If youre under age 59 an additional 10% penalty will be assessed as well. And dont forget non-qualified annuity basis is tax free, by inserting it into an IRA; you give up the tax free status of basis because all IRA distributions are an ordinary income tax event. Before moving forward with any changes consult a tax advisor or CPA."
Insurance,Can  You  Claim  A  Breast  Reduction  On  Medicare?,"The answer to your question is going to depend on if it is ""cosmetic surgery"" or is it medically necessary. Medicare and all health insurance policies have strict regulations about paying for ""cosmetic surgery"" and then what happens if you have complications from the suregery? I would recommend you rule out ""cosmetic surgery"" because once the invasion is made it exposes you to all the possiblities of infection or other complications. You can go to WEBSITELINK and type the procedure into the inquiry window and see what medicare says"
Insurance,Will  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Leaky  Roof?,"The damage caused as the result of a leaky roof is probably covered. The damage to the roof would be covered if caused by a named peril. If the roof leak is covered it will be covered as a depreciated item by most insurance companies, rather than replacement. It is important to stop the leak as quickly as possible regardless of whether there is coverage or not. The damage to a house by water can be quite severe."
Insurance,When  Does  Medicare  Cover  Blood  Tests?,"Medicare Part B covers most lab tests as long as they are medically necessary. Routine blood work in conjunction with your annual preventive care exam is usually covered at no charge to you. If your lab tests are diagnostic in nature, and considered medically necessary, they should be covered subject to the deductible and coinsurance."
Insurance,Can  Life  Insurance  Companies  Access  Medical  Records?,"Yes, life insurance companies access medical records with your permission. Depending on the size of the policy and company requirements, medical records may or may not be required for your policy. When you apply for life insurance, there is a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which provides permission for the insurance company to obtain and view your medical records. The medical records, along with a prescription check, MVR records, and exam are used to determine your eligibility for life insurance."
Insurance,How  Much  Is  Term  Life  Insurance  For  20  Years?,"There's many factors that go into the premiums for life insurance to say what a policy costs - it will be different for every person as we each have our own specific needs. The premium for a policy will depend on the insured's age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for (in this case, 20 year term insurance), their riskclassification (determined by your medical history), and whether they'reapplying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends ona number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has their own set of underwriting guidelines and mortality tables, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). Non-medical term life insurance policies will almost always cost much more than fully underwritten policies that require an exam because an insurance company is taking on more risk without having a full medical picture of you. Consult with an experienced life insurance broker to determine what coverage is appropriate/suitable for your needs and budget. Please feel free to contact me for help or if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Term  Of  Life  Insurance?,"If you actually buy Term Life Insurance, you get to pick the term, be it one year, five years, ten years, or even twenty years. But you need to pay the premium every year, or it will end. 97% of folks do not continue to pay and it ends for them. They then have to get another policy, only to find it costs more because they are older, or is not even available because of their health. A man in his 30's put off buying until last week, only to find he had developed MS and had to pay a much higher premium. He was lucky to be able to get insurance at all. Do not put off buying insurance. Something is always better than nothing. Getting Permanent Whole Life Insurance is the safest. The rates never go up and you can keep it your entire life, so long as the premiums are paid. A quality agent can help you determine what you can afford, and how to arrange a variety of possible alternative options. Gary Lane, Agent for New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thank you."
Insurance,What  Is  An  Annual  Premium  For  Home  Insurance?,"Great question. If you are asking what is...the cost...for a homeowner's policy, this may help you. Home policies are rated based on age of home, type of construction, occupancy and location. In my state, Florida, the distance to water is very important as well as the type of roof. There are two styles, gabled roofs (which are popular in the Northern States) and hip roof (which is a newer style and has better resistance to wind. (We have hurricanes here.)"
Insurance,What  Kind  Of  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?,"There are many choices of life insurance available to you. The main stream life insurance products are term life, universal life, variable life and whole life. Each one has a specific purpose. Term life insurance is meant to coverage a specific period of time. The common terms are 1-5-10-15-20-25-30-35 years. This means the rate or premium you purchase is guaranteed level for that period of time regardless of change in health, life style or occupation. Term life is commonly used for younger people starting out in life, covering a large debt, life a mortgage on a home or business debt, or covering for a young child's education. term life insurance allows for the largest face amount for the smallest premium payments. Universal life and variable life are permanent life insurance solutions that build cash value. Typically the premiums are more expensive and the face amounts are less because part of the premium is going into a cash value fund that can be invested with numerous options. The cash value can later be used for retirement, college funds, critical or chronic illness or even to purchase a large asset like a home. The universal and variable options are typically more aggressive with the cash value funds. The last option, whole life insurance, is very similar to the previous universal life insurance options. However, the cash value funds are typically a fixed percentage of growth. Whole life as it's name suggests is primarily meant to cover you for your entire life. I recommend using an experienced independent life insurance broker with numerous carriers to shop the market and find you the best product at the best price for your unique situation. Good luck."
Insurance,Is  Xarelto  Covered  By  Medicare?,"In most cases, Medicare does not cover medications unless you are hospitalized. To have coverage for your outpatient medical needs, you would need to purchase a Part D prescription drug plan. Each company offering this type of coverage has their own, unique formulary list of medications they consider to be covered expenses. It is always best to consult with an independent agent that represents many different companies to assist you in finding the absolute best coverage for your personal situation."
Insurance,I  Was  Fired  When  Does  My  Health  Insurance  Stop?,"It depends. In some cases your coverage stops the last day you were actively at work. In other cases, coverage continues to the end of the month or it may continue through the end of the following month. In most cases you will be eligible for COBRA and continue for up to 18 months."
Insurance,How  Does  Split  Dollar  Life  Insurance  Work?,"Split dollar arrangements can vary between a corporation and it's key executives, the grantor of an estate and it's associated irrecoverable life insurance trust or two parties that share an insurable interest. It is a sharing arrangement between two entities of death benefit and cash values of a life insurance policy."
Insurance,Is  It  Ok  To  Cancel  Life  Insurance?,"That is truly up to the policy owner. If you are purchasing a new policy that is providing for your coverage needs better than the current policy then it may. In most cases though depending on the amount of time that the life insurance policy has been in effect, it is not recommended to cancel a life insurance policy unless it is absolutely necessary. All licensed agent are ethically obligated to provide information that helps the proposed client make a decision that is in their best interest not that of the agent."
Insurance,Who  Should  Be  Beneficiary  On  Life  Insurance?,"It depends on the reason for the policy. Most people will select a spouse, parent or other family member. If the policy is for final expenses you can name the person who will be handling those affairs or even the funeral home. I do not recommend naming a child as beneficiary unless the money is earmarked for the child after he or she turns 18. Money left to the child will be held in trust until the child is of legal age."
Insurance,Can  You  Be  Dropped  From  Group  Health  Insurance?,"Yes, but not just because someone in the front office feels like picking on you that day. There would have to be some change in your eligibility status or what the company's policy is to trigger such an event. For example, you had your working hours reduced below 30 hours per week and this puts you below both your employer's and the Federal government's definition of what a full-time eligible employee is (30 or more hours per week defines a person as full-time for benefits eligibility under ObamaCare). This could trigger your still being an employee but no longer being eligible for their group health insurance plan. If you are responsible for paying a portion of your health insurance premium (and most employees are these days) and for some reason you are unable to pay your share of the premium (usually hard to do since these payments are generally taken out on a payroll deduction basis) then you could be terminated for non-payment of premium. Of course, if your employer decides to terminate their group health insurance plan entirely and you are dropped from coverage because a group plan no longer exists at your workplace you are obviously dropped. Though usually even small employers will try to give advance notice and employers (especially larger ones) are required to give a certain amount of advance notice of a plan change or termination. But you can't be dropped from your employer's coverage in an arbitrary manner while still an employee meeting all the eligibility requirements set forth under your employer's personnel policies and state and Federal laws. For example, you couldn't be terminated from the health insurance plan simply because your were running up a lot of expenses for your cancer treatment."
Insurance,Does  Life  Insurance  Cover  Cancer?,"Life insurance pays a death benefit regardless of the cause of death, including cancer. Some policies include an acceleratd death benefit that allows you to access a portion of the death proceeds if you have a terminal condition. In most cases death must be expected to occur withing 2 years of taking out the ""loan""."
Insurance,What  Is  Supplemental  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"A supplemental disability insurance is a personally owned long term disability policy usually purchased to supplement a group employer sponsored long term disability plan. You are basically ""supplementing"" your existing group plan with a personally owned policy. The reason this is necessary is because most group plans only cover 50- 60% of an employees income. A supplemental policy will provide additional coverage in addition to the group plan. The amount of supplemental disability coverage you can purchase is limited based on the insurance carriers guidelines. This is determined by the amount of your income your group plan covers and weather or not you pay for your group plan or your company does. As a general rule, most carriers won't let you insure more than 70% of your gross annual income."
Insurance,Can  Married  Children  stay  On  Parents  Auto  Insurance?,"Generally married children cannot be on the parents policy. What happens if you try to hide this ""material fact"" and you have an accident and now you need to file a claim? Usually if you are on your ""parents"" policy the parent is the ""primary"" driver and you are a child that just drives your parents car sporadically. If you or your spouse have a vehicle and you have the car financed in your name and your parents are not on the note-can you say Red Flag?"
Insurance,Can  You  Claim  Medicare  And  Private  Health?,"You can have Medicare and private health insurance, depending on the type of other insurance you have. You can have Medicare and a cancer plan, or hospital indemnity plan, or other ancillary form of coverage. You can have Medicare and employer group health insurance, or retiree group health.

You must inform your mortgage if you have a mortgage on your property. Make sure your new policy will cover the important things to you in your home.
Insurance,Who  To  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  From?,"It is a good idea to buy Long Term Care Insurance from a broker that carries multiple companies, or an agency that uses an LTCI broker (like ours does). That way you can be sure you are getting the most competitive rate, and will have the expertise of an agent that knows what you will qualify for. They can also guide you to the most important features, so that you can get the ones you need but not overspend for options that do not add much value."

Insurance,Is  Aflac  Cancer  Insurance  Worth  It?,"It does not matter if it is AFLAC or any other company, in my opinion Cancer insurance is a good buy. Even if a person has health insurance, the cost of Cancer can devastate a persons financial well being. With deductibles, copay's, travel, loss of income, and cost of alternative treatments, Cancer Insurance can make a difference between getting better care or going bankrupt."
Insurance,Can  You  Switch  Car  Insurance  Mid  Policy?,"Insurance policies can be cancelled. Many companies charge you for the number of days that you were covered. Some use another system that penalizes you a bit for cancelling before the end of the term. All you need to do is notify the company or your agent. All coverage ceases. This should not be done unless you no longer have the vehicle, or you are immediately placing insurance coverage with another company."
Insurance,My  Claim  Was  Denied  Due  To  My  Criminal  Record.  Is  That  Right?,"You are not required to accept the decision of the claims adjuster.

These companies will often refer their files to criminal prosecutors."

Insurance,When  Are  Life  Insurance  Proceeds  Taxed?,"In most cases, life insurance proceeds, the death benefit, are received income tax free by the beneficiary in most cases. This is a key feature of life insurance. Common exceptions include business-owned life insurance issued, or materially modified, after August 17, 2006 which may be taxable unless specific steps are taken during time of application and annually thereafter to meet conditions which allow the proceeds to be income tax-free. Another exception is a tax trap where life insurance contracts with three parties involved may also have unexpected taxable implications."
Insurance,Is  Accidental  Life  Insurance  Worth  It?,"Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) and accidental death benefit (ADB), either as a stand alone policy or as a rider on a life insurance policy, is inexpensive but I question its value. In some instances, it may make sense to the buyer. I don't follow industry sales data at this granular a level but I can safely say that it is neither offered nor sold as much as it was in the past when our economy was more industrial and agrarian than service oriented the way it is today."
Insurance,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tummy  Tuck?,A tummy tuck will be covered under your health insurance plan as long as it is considered (and coded) as medically necessary by your attending physician. Often times this is considered an elective procedure and won't be covered. It's vital to contact your carrier prior to the procedure to find out how (if at all) they will cover the surgery. The best place to start is to call the benefits verification or pre-certification phone number on the back of your insurance cards.
Insurance,Does  Health  Insurance  Typically  Cover  Otoplasty?,"Health insurance may cover otoplasty, although in most cases it does not. If it is considered cosmetic (and usually it is), it may not be paid or covered under a typical policy.

Insurance,Is  Life  Insurance  Part  Of  An  Estate  After  Death?,"The are many varying circumstances for lifeinsuranceproceeds. Life insurance is paid directly to the benefactresses of the life insurance policy. Generally most married couples use the marital deduction act to pass the proceeds and all other assets to the surviving spouse. If the proceeds remain with the surviving spouse, they are subject to federal and state estate taxation if the proceeds and all other assets exceed the federal unified credit and the state exemptions.If that possibility exists, then the policy or policies should be owned day one by an Irrecoverable Life Insurance Trust to avoid inclusion in the estate."
Insurance,When  Do  You  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The time to get DI is different for everyone depending on your occupation and health. The best answer is ... as soon as possible. DI is cheaper the younger you are, plus you never know if you might become sick or injured. If you're worried that you might make more money in the future, you can add a rider on your policy that will make you eligible for more coverage at a later date, or you can simply try to buy more DI when the time comes (assuming you don't have any serious medical issues when that time does come)."
Insurance,How  Do  I  Know  What  Health  Insurance  I  Have?,"Your policy provides your health plan information - it'll tell you the carrier name, your policy number, plan details including premiums, copayments, coinsurance, deductible, maximum out-of-pocket expense. If you're unsure of what you have exactly, you can always contact your health insurance agent to get more information. If you're looking for new coverage, I always recommend consulting with an experienced broker to make sure that what you have provides good coverage and meets your needs and budget. Experienced brokers will have an in-depth knowledge of products from multiple carriers, can review a wide range of options with you, and help you determine which program will best serve your needs. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Average  Salary  Of  A  Life  Insurance  Agent?,"That's a great question! An insurance agent most often works off of a payment that is made to them when they sell a policy or product for the company - called a commission. These commissions can be fairly sizable, or very small, depending upon the sale. Therefore, in most cases, the earnings of the insurance agent depend entirely upon their ability to sell, and the product commission that is paid upon the sale. I believe the vast majority of agents will tailor the right product to the needs of the client, but there will unfortunately always be a few that are more interested in commission than client. You are always wise to have an idea of what it is that you want, and if you feel pressured, to ask for time to think it over. Follow your instincts. If you were considering a career as an agent, be aware that the start up period can be really lean until you've gotten your client base built, and you may need to have another source of income, especially if you were accustomed to a steady paycheck. Once you get rolling, if you are motivated, honest, and good with your clients, you can make a very comfortable living. Anything I can do to help, I'm happy to - feel free to contact me. Thanks for asking!"

Typically, if coverage is offered, it may not be paid in full by the owner. But most importantly, can you get a good haircut at Great Clips? It's just my opinion, but my answer would be Yes!"
Insurance,Is  Krystexxa  Covered  By  Medicare?,"Krystexxa is a medication used to treat gout and can be effective when other treatments have not produced the desired results. FDA approval for Krystexxa was granted in 2010. In 2011 Medicare assigned a treatment code to Krystexxa. Krystexxa is infusion therapy, covered under Medicare Part B. Due to the cost ($60,000 per year) there may be limits placed on how many treatments will be approved by Medicare."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Right  Amount  Of  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Talk tot your insurance professional and ask for a current ""Reconstruction Analysis"" for your home. Be sure to detail any improvements or renovations that you may have made so that these can be properly factored into the calculation. The result of this analysis, if completed properly, will be an accurate measure of what it would cost to reconstruct your home as it is today, should it be severely damaged or lost due to a covered peril. Once this figure is determined, be sure to ask if the policy includes a form or ""replacement Guarantee"" to make sure that moving forward you will remain properly covered."
Insurance,How  Much  Is  Car  Insurance  For  A  17  Year  Old  Female  In  California?,"In California the sex of the driver does not play a role in the price of car insurance. The year make and model of the car are important, as is the annual mileage of the vehicle. The driving record of every driver in the household is very important and the years of experience as a driver are also very important. These factors illustrate that the rating is complex and you should meet with a trusted insurance agent to guide you through the process."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Cover  Xanax?,"Xanax is a prescription drug used most often to treat anxiety. Some Medicare Part D will cover at least a portion of the cost of Xanax.

How long do you need it? What gender are you? Are you smoker? Are you healthy? Is your family health historygood? Do you have dangerous recreational activities? Is your motor vehicle record clean? Do you have substance abuse problems with drugs oralcohol? Do you have a felony? Is your credit good? Just to name a few of the factors that enter into the price tag of lifeinsurance."
Insurance,Should  I  Buy  Life  Insurance  When  I  Am  Young?,"Life insurance is always cheapest now. The exception would be a smoker who quits, then applies a year later. Of course going without insurance for that year carries the risk of dying during that time without providing for yourfinal expenses, or thefinancial needs of loved ones. Do it now."
Insurance,How  To  Choose  Medigap  Insurance?,"The best way to choose a Medigap Policy is by working with a licensed independent agent who specializes in Medicare Supplement insurance. We work closely with you to make sure you understand the benefits associated with each Medigap Plan. All Medigap Plan benefits are standardized, so if you want the benefits of Plan F, it's the same exact coverage with every insurance company. The only difference is the price.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance."
Insurance,What  Kind  Of  Health  Insurance  Is  Best?,"The best type of health insurance really depends on your circumstances. For example, generally healthy individuals with additional cash on hand are often best suited by High Deductible Health Insurance Plans as they can cover the high deductible if in the rare chance they should require considerable health care. The deductible acts as a stop loss against their total risk of expense exposure. Individuals with less cash on hand, and or those with medical conditions that require more frequent trips to the doctor are generally better suited by Managed Health Care systems like Heath Maintenance Organizations or Preferred Provider Organizations with low deductibles and/or co-pays."
Insurance,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  STD  Testing?,"Coverage for testing/screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has been standard practice in the group and individual health insurance marketplaces for many years. What is covered and how may have varied from state to state. Under the requirements of ObamaCare, health insurance policies compliant with that law will have to cover testing for HIV and a variety of other STDs. So, certainly, policies purchased on or after January 1, 2014 should offer rather extensive coverage for STD testing and in most cases one would expect testing/screening to be covered under the preventive care requirements of ObamaCare which means 100% coverage with no copays, deductibles or co-insurance cost sharing. Testing done for treatment purposes and monitoring after an initial diagnosis has been made are then subject to the plan's treatment coverage provisions. So, the very same test done at no charge to diagnose an STD may be subject to a copay, deductible and/or co-insurance when done in conjunction with chronic disease management/treatment."
Insurance,What  Are  Immediate  Annuities?,"When you look into an Annuity you have a variety of ways to fund it. You can make monthly payments, you can make a lump sum payment and you can make lump sum to start off and add to it.

People who want to have a steady monthly payment tend to utilize this type of annuity so they can get regular payments from the insurer."
Insurance,What  Does  A  Health  Insurance  Premium  Mean?,"This is the term used to describe the monthly obligation you pay to have the policy. Think of it in terms of ""payment"". Premiums will vary on a policy depending on the type of policy it is, the deductible, the co payment, whether you have dental or vision, etc. Most people keep policies longer the more affordable a monthly premium is to their budget."
Insurance,What  Happens  To  People  With  Cancer  And  No  Insurance?,"Since you are asking this in the critical illness section I will assume you have health insurance. Your major medical health insurance plan will pay the bulk of your medical bills but you will still be personally responsible for your out of pocket costs including copay's, deductibles, coinsurance and so forth."
Insurance,When  Does  Mandated  Health  Insurance  Start?,Mandated insurance starts October 1st 2013 when Exchanges begin to operate.Insurance policies purchase on the exchange wont be effective until January 2014.Most or all Health Insurance Companies are already selling plans that meet parts of the mandate that is already in effect.

Insurance,Does  medicare  limit  the  number  of  echocardiograms  one  can  have  in  any  given  amount  of  time?,"Medicare will cover an echocardiogram if your doctor orders it for diagnostic purposes. An Echo is covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare will pay for about 80% of the costs after the Part B deductible is met ($147 in 2014) - you would be responsible for the other 20% and the Part B deductible. When you first enroll in Medicare Part B, you open your 6-month initial open enrollment period to buy a Medicare supplement plan (a.k.a. Medigap plan) with NO MEDICAL UNDERWRITING!. A Medigap plan can cover the deductibles and a portion or all of the other 20% of expenses covered by Part B and features a number of other big advantages as well. An experienced Medigap broker can help find the Medigap plan and carrier that's most suitable for you and your budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,How  To  Determine  Term  Life  Insurance  Amount?,"Many life insurance experts recommend about 6 to 8 times your annual salary for the amount of term life insurance that you may need; however, the figure will depend on your financial needs and goals. You have to factor in that mortgage, education expenses for children...basically whatever your family will need to survive and thrive when you're gone. Of course, since term life insurance is for a specific period of time, you will need to calculate how long you need this certain amount of money as well."
Insurance,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  Glaucoma?,Glaucoma is a serious illness that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated. Glaucoma is easily treated in most patients and can be controlled with prescription eye drops. In some cases glaucoma cannot be successfully treated with eye drops and surgery is required. Either conventional blade surgery or laser surgery may be needed to treat the condition. Most major medical health insurance plans will cover glaucoma treatment.
Insurance,What  Does  Disability  Insurance  Protect?,"Disability Insurance protects your paycheck. Only people who draw an income can purchase Disability Insurance, and the benefit you can get is based on your income. If you were injured and unable to go to work, or got an illness that caused you to be off of work, or had complications in childbirth that kept you from going back to work as planned, Disability Insurance will pay a large % of your paycheck to you in cash each week. You can use this money just as you would have used the paycheck you earned through your job. So in essence, DI also protects your family, your home, and your lifestyle."
Insurance,Should  Car  Insurance  Increase  Every  Year?,"If the cost of auto repairs hasnt increased and damages awarded in lawsuits hasnt increased, auto insurance probably shouldnt increase. Your state insurance commissioner keeps a close eye on insurance cost in your states. He does this for two reasons. The first is to make sure that the public isnt being charged too much and the second is to make sure that the insurance companies are taking in sufficient money to honor all of the promises that they have made. The real cost of automobile insurance is determined when you have a claim. If the policy limit is exceeded and angry people are suing you, you paid too much for your insurance. If your policy had high limits and took care of everything, then you bought cheap insurance. Having to settle a claim out of your own pocket is the most expensive form of insurance that you can purchase. The reason that insurance premiums increase is that the company pays out more than it can afford to pay out. It is a simple balance sheet calculation. When the company finds that they are paying out more in claims than they are receiving in premiums they file with the state insurance commissioner to review and adjust rates in your state. Several things cause the claims experience of a company to increase. It could be that the frequency of claims increases. This could be the result of reduced safety enforcement, poorer road conditions or a variety of other causes. It could be that the severity of claims has increased. This would be the result of an increasing number of accidents turning into lawsuits. It also could be caused by juries making increasingly high awards to those injured in accidents. It also could be the result of increased medical costs in your area. Another factor could be the cost of auto repairs. Materials and parts tend to become more expensive over time and this could affect the claims experience of a company. It is important to note that most companies in the state will feel similar pressure at the same time as those factors affect all the companies. There are moral factors that also come to affect the premiums of auto insurance. When drivers report fewer annual miles than they actually drive, that increases their exposure without increasing the premium for their policy. If people allow other drivers to operate their vehicles without adequate supervision of screening risky drivers could be populating the streets. Even though your state requires that vehicles be insured we all know that some are not and that expense has to be shared somewhere. A frequent abuse is the pizza delivery man who is driving the family sedan. His insurance policy never knew he was doing that and has a risk that hasnt been properly evaluated. There are far more lurid cases but my all-time favorite is the family sedan that has steel tanks welded underneath the body to carry illegal liquor. All these moral issues also affect the premium."
Insurance,Which  Is  Better  Medicare  Or  Medicare  Advantage?,"Original Medicare, with or without a supplement plan, allows you to use any doctor, lab or hospital anywhere in the U.S. that accepts Medicare assignment. Most Medicare Advantage plans have limited network that require you to use their participating facilities or else you pay a significant penalty for out of network benefits."
Insurance,What  Will  Void  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"what will void a life insurance policy ? Basically any deciet given during the application process will void a policy if found out within the first two policy years. After that, in most cases contestability by an insurance carrier has ended. Except some states have modified contestibility laws sometimes in the insurance company's favor. In my state, concerning lying about smoking on the application, there is no limit for an insurance company to contest. The state considers the policy null and void. Other states may have something similar."
Insurance,Does  Liberty  Mutual  Have  Life  Insurance?,"Liberty Mutual offers life insurance issued by Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston, MA. The type of life insurance products that are offered by Liberty Life are Term Life, Whole Life and Universal Life.

Insurance,Does  Variable  Life  Insurance  Have  A  Cash  Value?,"Cash value permanent life insurance has the potential to accumulate cash values, but it's dependent on the crediting method. Variable life insurance uses a guaranteed interest rate account and separate sub accounts that use equities and bond investments.

Insurance,Can  I  Buy  A  Life  Insurance  Policy  On  My  Parents?,"You can purchase life insurance coverage on anyone you share an economic insurable interest, including parents. Of course, they need to sign as the policy insured on the application and have to be mentally competent to do so. Life insurance policies held between different family generations are quite common."
Insurance,Can  Home  Insurance  Cover  Plumbing?,Homeowners insurance will not cover plumbing for normal wear and tear. In other words if the pipes just get old and you need new pipes they are not covered. If a pipe were to burst suddenly and flood your kitchen for example the insurance would pick up the damage caused by the water but will not fix the pipe. This is assuming of course water damage is not excluded from your policy.
Insurance,How  To  Get  Health  Insurance  For  A  LLC?,"Purchasing health insurance for an LLC is no different than applying for an individual or group health insurance plan. If the LLC has few or one one employee then individual policies would make the most financial sense. If the LLC wants to provide benefits for all its employees then either a small group plan or a defined benefit plan will make sense. Group's plans require an in depth fact finding analysis to uncover the true needs of the group. Important factors include: Size of the group Number of employee participating Amount employer wants to subsidize - if any? Type of benefits Are employees local or spread out among states The new trend in 2014 for small group is setting up a defined contribution plan (section 105 plan) where the employer subsidizes a set amount to employees tax-free and the employees use that money to offset their health insurance premium, costs etc for the individual plans they purchase."
Insurance,How  To  Set  Up  A  Trust  For  Life  Insurance?,"To set up an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT), it is best to use an attorney who is an expert at tax laws to set up the trust. Then use a respected life insurance agent to help you obtain a policy, or transfer existing life insurance, into the trust. You will need to choose a trustee to administer the trust (this could be the lawyer). Working together, you will get a trust that works for your lifetime."
Insurance,Can  You  Get  Medicare  While  Working?,"Yes, you can be on Medicare while working. Many people do postpone going on Medicare if they're still working because they may have group health insurance available to them through their employer. Self-employed individuals will usually go on Medicare when they turn 65 unless they have group coverage available through their spouse's work. Some may decide to go on Medicare if they're 65 and still working because they want a more predictable health expense structure and/or want to lower their premiums."
Insurance,Where  Do  I  Buy  Life  Insurance?,"You can buy life insurance online, by mail, or by meeting with an agent at their office or your home. Life insurance policies that are purchased without any contact with an agent are usually simplified issue policies. They generally are for smaller face amounts and do not require an exam. While the transaction can be simple, it takes a pretty insurance savvy person to read and understand all the fine print. Thus, it is easy to get declined, or not get the price or policy you were seeking. I recommend calling an agency that carries both simplified and fully underwritten policies, so that you can ask questions and will be given an accurate description of each type of policy before you make your decision. Most types of life insurance can be purchased online or by meeting with an agent face to face. Looking at testimonials and checking Better Business Bureau ratings can be helpful in determining which agency you want to patronize. Reading answers from different agents on this website is also a good way to ""meet"" us and decide for yourself who appears to be knowledgeable and trustworthy."
Insurance,What  Makes  Car  Insurance  Cheaper?,"If you are asking what helps keep your auto insurance rates lower, then there are many factors that can help with this. A clean driving record would be the first - no tickets and no accidents. A high credit score would be another. If you are a student a 3.50 gpa or above will typically get you a discount. A married person will typically have lower rates than a single person. There are many other factors can come into play here also, but these are some of the most prominent ones."
Insurance,How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Claim  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Death claims are handled quickly. The company needs a death certificate and in some cases a simple form. When the death is under investigation, or the body has not been recovered, the claim can take a long time. Ultimately a court will decide when the insurance company should honor the claim and to whom the proceeds should be paid."
Insurance,"I  am  a  non  driver  and  need  a  truck  for  my  work,  I  would  like  to  insure  my  helper  to  drive  for  me  any  problems?","If you are insuring a vehicle for your business you can write the business auto policy and list your employee or employees as a drivers. You have the ability to exclude yourself from the policy. But keep in mind, this would mean you can not drive the vehicle at anytime as you yourself would then be un-insured."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Best  Medicare  Health  Plan?,"The best Medicare health plan is one that meets your expectations for coverage and price. There are basically two types of Medicare health plans. One is a supplement to traditional Medicare and covers some or all of your out of pocket expenses. These are referred to as Medigap or Medicare supplement plans. The other is a Medicare Advantage plan that replaces traditional Medicare. With Advantage plans your doctor, if they accept your Advantage plan, files claims direct with the insurance carrier. Advantage plans have networks, a lot of moving parts and a lot of out of pocket. #GeorgiaMedicarePlans"
Insurance,What  Is  Group  Disability  Insurance?,"Group Disability Insurance is disability insurance coverage offered to a group of employees through their employer or entity for which they work. It is one of the benefits offered to some employees. If the employer pays the Disability Group Insurance premiums for the employee, disability income benefits would be taxable to the employee when used."
Insurance,Can  You  Claim  Lost  Car  Keys  On  Insurance?,"Yes you could if you had comprehensive coverage. However since most key costs are under the deductible amount it would not make much sense to ruin your claims free discount in order to receive $0 from the insurance company. Even if you had a $100 deductible and the electronic keys were $150, the discounts lost plus having a claim on your record would outweigh any benefit to receiving the $50."
Insurance,Which  Car  Insurance  Company  Is  Best?,"Car insurance companies that do business in your state are regulated by two state insurance commissioners, your state and the state where the company is domiciled. Your state commissioner is trying to allow companies to operate in your state that will keep their promises. The best auto insurance company is one that keeps its promises."
Insurance,Who  Writes  Vacant  Home  Insurance?,There are many carriers that will write coverage for a vacant home. There are of course requirements/standards that the home must meet before a carrier will provide coverage. A carrier that is in my geographic location that I work with that provides this type of coverage is Foremost. I would suggest contacting local agents in your area to find out about availability and pricing in your area.
Insurance,What  Type  Of  Water  Damage  Is  Covered  By  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Not all! Accidental discharge of water and its attendant damages is normally covered. This means when there is an accidental discharge of liquids or steam from the plumbing, heating or air-conditionaing the loss is a covered loss. It is very important to understand what is not covered. Flood is one of the most common causes of loss in the US and the homeowner's policy does not cover it. Water back up such as from a blocked sewer line is not a covered loss (some companies offer the coverage as an option.) When there is repeated or continuous seepage or leakage from a system in the house that is not covered."
Insurance,When  Getting  Car  Insurance  What  Information  Is  Needed?,"Great Question. You will need to provide your personal and vehicleinformation such as: Your full name Driver's license number & expiration date. Possibly your social security number depending on what state you live in. date of birth address of where the car is located and mailing address if different vehicle information such as Year, Make, Model, & V.I.N which is a 17 digit number Is the vehicle garaged or not? How is the vehicle used? How many miles are currently on the vehicle and how many miles to you drive on an annual basis? Names of any possible drivers or people living with you along with their personal information if they wish to drive the vehicle. Need to know who your current insurance is with or if you have had coverage in the past You will need to determine how much coverage you need in place and what deductibles you would be comfortable having in place. There are probably a few more questions that you would need to answer prior to binding coverage, but that is a quick list of information you should have handy when you are ready to pursue auto insurance quotations. I hope this helps and have a wondeful day. Best, Josh DeBoer Producer Fred Daniel & Sons, Inc"
Insurance,Do  I  Need  Builders  Risk  Insurance  To  Purchase  A  Home  Where  We  will  Do  Major  Renovations  Before  Moving  In?,"I don't recommend using the builder to purchase the builders risk policy on a renovation project. You need coverage on the existing structure and most builders would not be covering anything but the renovation amount. They would only be covering the amount of the renovation. Purchasing the policy yourself puts you in control of the policy and allows you to make sure that you are adequately covered. In looking at David's response, I am in agreement that you should be named as additional insured on the contractors general liability policy and also get a certificate for their workers compensation."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Cover  Ptosis?,There are situations where Medicare will cover Ptosis. Your eye care provider will measure the amount of droop and advise you if the surgery is a covered expense or not. They can also tell you if there may be any excess charges that are part of your treatment that may not be covered by Medicare.
Insurance,How  Much  More  Does  Medicare  Advantage  Cost?,How much more than what? You can find Medicare Advantage plans from zero premium on up. So I guess you would have to say it costs exactly the same as original Medicare A&B. You can spend more though if you want to. Some Medicare Advantage plans do have a premium. You should review the options in your county at www.medicare.gov or talk with your local insurance agent that specializes with Medicare Insurance Plans.
Insurance,Can  You  Change  From  Medicare  Advantage  To  Medigap?,You can disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan and switch back to Original Medicare from January 1 thru February 14 of each year. You will need to get a Medicare Supplement and Prescription Drug Plan. If you have serious health conditions you may not be qualify for a Medicare Supplement. Depending on the pre-existing condition you could be denied coverage or have to pay a much higher premium because of the pre-existing condition. It would be very important to talk with a qualified agent before you make your decision to disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan.
Insurance,Will  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Mold  Damage?,"There are hundreds of species of mold common to the United States. Small areas of visible mold that build up on moist areas in a home not only look bad but are also a health risk, the mold may cause allergy like symptoms and/or breathing difficulties. Basic home insurance policies, generally limit coverage for mold or exclude it. It is very easy for mold to grow given suitable conditions in a home that doesn't show pride of ownership; mold claims became so excessive in prior years, the insurance industry chose to limit or exclude coverage rather than raise premium to address the growing claims. Although the standard coverage will vary from State to State as well as vary between insurance carriers, it is important to view your specific insurance policy to find out if there is coverage for mold and what the limit is.In some cases, a carrier will actually allow an extended amount of coveragefor an additional premium. It is best to maintain a clean and moisture free structure to prevent the growth of mold. In homes with a basement, it is important to remove all moisture as quickly as possible following any leaks. The Federal EPA recommends homeowners clean up any area affected by mold which is less than 10 square feet using bleach or a suitable product, any area larger than that should involve a professional."
Insurance,What  Insurance  Will  I  Need  In  Retirement?,"Your insurance needs do not disappear at retirement although the coverage amounts may change. Car Insurance, home owners insurance, health insurance and life insurance all play a part in a solid financial plan. You should contact an Agent and have them conduct an Insurance preview. The last thing you want in retirement is to be paying for something that you really don't need to."
Insurance,What  Is  A  Cafeteria  Plan  For  Health  Insurance?,"A ""cafeteria plan"" refers to the section 125 of the tax code. A cafeteria plan allows you to have dollars deducted from your payroll at your employment to pay for some health insurance costs with ""pretax dollars"" like child care or prescriptions and doctor visits expenses, and to save for retirement. While the plans may vary from employer to employer in exact details you would be smart to utilize that ""cafeteria plan"". One word of caution- make sure any dollars saved if not used this year rolls over to the next year and that you DO NOT LOSE THE DOLLARS"

Insurance,Does  My  Medicare  Cover  My  Wife?,Your wife must be qualified for Medicare to receive benefits. If you are over 65 and on Medicare she can qualify based on your work history. If your wife is not yet 65 or Social Security Disability then she will have to pick up a private insurance plan until she is eligible for Medicare. She cannot be covered by your benefits.
Insurance,What  Are  The  Coverage  Characteristics  Of  Home  Insurance?,"A home is the largest single purchase that most people make in their lifetime. There are two characteristics that make home ownership difficult. The first is that the ownership of a home creates a situation of responsibility where you become responsible for personal injury and property damage that comes out of home ownership. For example, someone enters you home, slips on a rug and falls. Injuries can be minor or severe. It is quite possible that you could be sued to recover the loss sustained by the person who fell. This is a liability loss. The second is that you have an enormous amount of your money and the mortgage companys money invested in the home. It is usually a multiple of your annual income and would represent a great financial loss were the home to be destroyed. Your mortgage company is particularly concerned about losing their collateral and will require hazard insurance to protect their interests to the greatest extent possible. The list of things that could happen to damage a residence is lengthy but most of the causes or perils are contained in the HO-3 Homeowners policy. There are notable exceptions which should be restated. You are probably not covered for damage caused by earthquake or flood. These coverages are available but in slightly different forms and often with different policies. Because an individual cannot sustain the personal loss of a law suit or the destruction of their property they turn to an insurance company to pool their risk with hundreds of thousands of other residences. This recognizes the probability of damage and spreads that risk over a large number of residences. The insurance company charges enough to be able to pay those losses when they occur. Your state insurance commissioner is very concerned about the adequacy of the insurance companies admitted in your state. While there are various types of home insurance policies, I will confine my comments to the most common, the HO-3 Homeowners policy. Coverage A in a homeowners policy covers your residence. The coverage includes additional items but does not cover land or water. It doesnt cover trees except as covered in incidental coverages. Coverage B covers related structures on the property. It has the same restrictions as Coverage A and doesnt cover any business structures, except for a residence on the property that you lease to others. It covers you garage Coverage C covers the personal property that you either own or are responsible for. This is a very important coverage and contains internal limits on selected classes of property such as money, securities, jewelry, guns and watercraft. Misunderstandings often arise about this coverage and it should be discussed thoroughly with your insurance agent. Modifications of this coverage are relatively inexpensive and an unpaid claim is an expensive way to discover that you werent adequately covered. Coverage D pays the necessary and reasonable increase in living cost you incur when your household meets with an insured loss. The company will try to get you back into your residence as quickly as possible but will make sure that you are able to maintain your normal standard of living during the repairs. Coverage D also covers the loss of rents you might experience in the event of a covered loss. If you have an apartment on the premises and it is damaged by a covered loss, this section would apply. There are other limits and extensions in this section that require your attention if you are leasing property. There are number of ancillary coverages including credit cards, trees, fire department charges, debris removal, emergency removal of covered property and grave markers. There are several pages of definitions and exclusions which should be read. Most confusion arising from a homeowners policy come from this part of the policy. Many people think that a homeowners policy pays for routine maintenance or deterioration. Coverage L covers personal liability and provides that the company will pay up to the limits for expense that you are liable for because of bodily injury or property damage that happens on your premises. Coverage M covers medical payments to others and provides necessary medial expenses if they are incurred on your property and result in bodily injury. There are several pages of definitions and limitations on liability coverage. The policy then defines your responsibilities. You must notify the company of a loss, you must cooperate and many other responsibilities. At the back of the policy are a number of endorsements which changes the policy. These apply to specific types of property such as trading cards, animals, a roof and others. Together the HO-3 Homeowners policy is a package of protection that is sufficiently broad to meet the requirements of both lenders and homeowners. Special additional coverages are offered and should be considered. Many of these additional coverages can be included in the basic policy."
Insurance,What  Is  Survivorship  Universal  Life  Insurance?,"The only thing that separates this from other policies is the word survivorship. What this means is that the policy covers at least 2 individuals and it only pays a benefit with the last one dies. Survivorship policies are usually smaller face amount policies taken out by couples with larger estates. The reason they do this is to use the death benefit to cover or offset estate taxes for their heirs. I have personally not seen one done with a universal life policy. Reason being is the cost. In a majority of cases, it would probably be more cost-effective to use a traditional whole life policy for this purpose."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  A  Walker?,Yes - Medicare covers walkers under Part B as durable medical equipment (DME) when prescribed by your doctor for use in your home. Medicare will generally pay approximately 80% of the costs - you would be responsible for the other 20%. A Medicare supplement (Medigap) plan can help cover the expenses you're responsible for paying.
Insurance,How  Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  As  A  High  Risk  Driver?,Just because you are a high risk driver doesn't mean you can't find auto insurance. As long as you have a valid driver's license and are willing to pay the required premium you should be able to find coverage. Call a local agent to find out more about coverage availability and pricing.
Insurance,Which  Annuity  Is  Right  For  Me?,"You have to establish product suitability before deciding on any product, much less an annuity, which should be purchased as an ultimate income product. Product suitability is based on your personal financial profile, risk tolerance and economic goals. Those three areas comprise the fundamental approach to selecting the right annuity. Annuities use differing crediting methods such as interest rates, indices (both domestic and foreign) and separate sub accounts that use equities and bond allocations."
Insurance,Can  You  Get  Life  Insurance  While  Pregnant?,"I just asked this question of several companies for someone I know and the answer is yes. The rating will the same as if you were not pregnant, if in the first trimesters. There are also no exam policies that you can get all the way through the third trimester."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Insurance  Cover  Dental?,"Routine dental checkups, cleanings, dental x-rays, crowns, etc. are not covered under original Medicare (parts A & B). You would need to buy a separate dental insurance plan to cover these benefits. If you have a medically necessary procedure completed in a hospital such as the repair of a broken jaw, then Medicare would cover it because it was an emergency situation. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  If  I  Have  Diabetes?,Yes you can. The rate will depend on age of onset and degree of control. You will probably pay a higher rate but you can get insurance.

Insurance,What  Company  Has  The  Best  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The best long term care insurance company and its product must be determined by gender, age, smoking status, health history and current health condition. That being said, there are only a half dozen or so long term care insurance companies in the brokerage market. Genworth should be considered as a leader in the long term care insurance market."
Insurance,What  Is  Basic  Life  And  Ad  D  Insurance?,"Basic life insurance pays a beneficiary if death of the insured person occurs by any reason (except suicide in the first two years). AD&D stands for Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance. It pays the beneficiary if death occurs by accident, or it pays the insured person if they lose a limb. Basic Life with AD&D is most likely a policy that combines both those types of insurance."
Insurance,Does  Medicare  Cover  Compounded  Drugs?,"In order for compounded drugs to be covered by Medicare Part D, they must be prescribed for a ""medically accepted indication"", they must have at least one ingredient that is FDA approved, and at least one ingredient must be covered by Medicare Part D. Only that FDA approved ingredient and the fees for mixing the drug are covered by Medicare. Bulk powders are not covered."
Insurance,What  Is  Participation  Rate  In  Annuities?,"Generally speaking, tax deferred index annuities use domestic and foreign indices for its crediting method. But there are three crediting method types within any one policy (sometimes more) that play a role in what you receive from the indice performance: spreads, rate caps and participation percentage. Participation determines what portion of the performance is credited to the annuity policy, i.e. 70% of a 10% net return would credited 7%."
Insurance,What  Is  A  5  Year  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"As mentioned above, a 5 year term insurance is an insurance policy that is in force for 5 years then expires. It is designed for a short term need and or specifically for the purpose of converting to a Whole Life policy within that 5 year period. Most Term policies are ""convertible"" to permanent insurance and some companies limit the type of permanent insurance their term policies may be converted to. In ""converting"" a term to a permanent policy what happens is the face amount of the Term, or a portion of that amount is converted to a Whole Life or Universal life policy without the insured having to undergo additional medical testing or underwriting. The premiums paid to the Term policy are not credited to the new permanent policy and the new premium will be based on the current age of the insured."
Insurance,How  Do  You  Set  Up  Annuities?,"You will need to contact a good insurance agent who is familiar with annuities and can offer a multitude of companies. The agent can examine your needs, goals and personal circumstances and help determine if an annuity is suitable for you, and if so help direct you to an annuity that fits your circumstances. The agent will then help you apply."
Insurance,When  Is  Permanent  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Idea?,When permanent life insurance is a good thing? That depends on who you ask!

It offers a guaranteed interest rate and with mutual providers it also offers dividends. It is a much better vehicle to save and grow your money that any bank instruments - guaranteed returns and Liquid for your use. Also with tax benefits not offered anywhere else! So when is permanent life insurance a good thing...ALLways!
Insurance,How  Long  Will  Disability  Insurance  Pay?,"Disability insurance will pay benefits to the disabled person according to the terms of the policy that was purchased.

The duration of the plan dictates how long the Disability Insurance pays. This may be a few years all the way to age 65."

Insurance,How  Much  Is  Life  Insurance  For  A  60  Year  Old?,"There's many factors that go into the premium calculations for life insurance to say what coverage will cost for a 60 year old - it will be different for every person due to a number of factors including their age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for, their risk classifcation, and whether they're applying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. At age 60, you'll have term life insurance options for 10, 15, 20, or 25 years - 30 years term insurance would not be available due to age - you would need to look at permanent programs to secure coverage longer than 25 years. If you want to consider coverage beyond 25 years, I would suggest looking at a Guaranteed Universal Life insurance policy (GUL). If you're looking for something in the $100,000, 10yr term insurance range, you could be looking at premiums as low as $28 per month (at preferred plus risk class) to over $100+ per month (if you're table-rated), it ultimately depends on the risk classification you qualify for. $250,000, 15 yr term can be as low as $82 per month or over $154 per month at standard risk class. So on and so forth. However, any numbers I quote without more details regarding your medical history will be useless. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends on a number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, prescriptions you take, your height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, family medical history, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has different underwriting guidelines, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). You should always consult with an experienced life insurance broker before applying for ANY coverage. Brokers can shop the case for you among a number of insurance companies to see which one will work best for your program and help you structure a policy that will best serve your needs and your budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,Can  You  Have  Two  Medicare  Supplements?,"No - only one Medicare supplement plan will pay after Medicare pays. If you try to have 2 Medicare supplement plans, you're spending extra money on the 2nd plan for no reason because it won't pay any benefits. Only one supplement plan will pay. The cost of 2 plans would also be more than having 1 Medigap plan F that covers all 9 benefits at 100%. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any questions. Thanks very much."
Insurance,What  Is  The  Benefit  Of  Renters  Insurance?,Renters insurance is for renters of homes and apartments as house insurance is for those who own the house. Renters insurance protects YOUR property if there is a loss from say a fire. The biggest issue is what kind of policy you have. Does your insurance give yoy replacement cost or just current value. There is a big difference. Think about what you stuff costs today versus purchasing brand new.
Insurance,Does  Life  Insurance  Cover  Alcoholism?,"That is a great question! The answer is yes, unless the answer on the application about drinking was falsified, (generally along the lines of ""have been told they have, been treated for, or prescribed medication for alcohol abuse/dependency or addiction?"", or ""been asked to reduce the intake of or discontinue use of drugs or alcohol?"") or the death occurred as a result of a crime committed while under the influence. Many policies will not pay if the death occurs because of criminal activity, and drunk driving would fall under that category. If the death occurs from long term chronic abuse, the policy should pay, but I'd have your agent confirm that for you. Thanks for asking!"
Insurance,How  Much  Is  A  Good  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Asking how much life insurance cost is like asking a realtor how much a house costs. Could be $30,000 or $30 million it depends on what you want. The factors that an agent or life insurance company would need to begin the quoting process is type of policy,how much face amount, for how long, age, build, state of residence, tobacco use andgeneral health status. From there an agent or broker can get fairly close to a premium quote but understand the underwriters have the final say on your unique premium."
Insurance,Does  QDRO  Apply  To  Life  Insurance?,"QDRO or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order comes through the courts in a divorce case. This order typically deals with divorce settlements concerning finances and retirement plans such as IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401Ks, 403bs and cash value life insurance plans. If you or your ex spouse owns cash value life insurance, then yes, the cash value is included in QDRO calculations. In most cases, term life insurance plans are not included in these calculations because there is no value unless a death occurs. You or your ex spouse can also be court ordered to carry a term life policy to cover alimony and or child support in case of an early death."
Insurance,Can  An  80  Year  Old  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,The time to purchase Long Term Care is when you are healthy and in your fifties or sixties. I do not know of any company that will issue a Long Term Care Policy to an eighty year old and if there were the premium would be extremely high. There are some alternatives however. Some companies will offer Short Term Care or Home Health Care policies up to age 85. While not as comprehensive as a full Long Term Care policy they can help with the high cost of care when needed. There are also other planning solutions that can help. A Long Term Care Resource Planner can help find a solution.
Insurance,Can  You  Cash  Out  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Certainly if it is your retirement plan you can cash out. However, there are many things to consider. If you are younger than 59.5 years old you will incur income taxes and a 10% penalty plus the fees associated from companies and advisors who will charge withdrawal fees and surrender charges. It is not advised just to ""cash out"" a retirement plan at any age. I highly recommend finding a trusted advisor to walk you through this process."
Insurance,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Foreclosure?,Renters nor any other property insurance is designed to insurance against a foreclosure. I have to assume since you arereferencinga renters policy that you are the tenant and your landlord is beingforeclosedon forcing you to move out.Unfortunatelyform an insurance standpoint there is nothing that can be done and you will have to startshoppingfor a new home. Yourrenterspolicy can betransferredto your new address. I would further discussthesituation with your local agent.
Insurance,What  Is  Private  Disability  Insurance?,"Private Disability Insurance is Disability Insurance that is purchased privately vs being supplied by the insured person's employer in a group policy. Persons who are self employed, or who do not have group Disability Insurance because their employer does not offer it, are most likely to buy private Disability Insurance."
